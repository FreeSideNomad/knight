  alignmentToProductVision: |
    This release directly delivers on the CommercePay Product Vision's first strategic
    objective: "Enable real-time online account opening with automated KYC/AML for
    simple business clients." It establishes the foundation platform capabilities
    (identity verification, compliance screening, core banking integration) that all
    future releases will build upon. Success in Release 1.0 validates our dual-channel
    digital strategy and positions us to accelerate Release 2.0 and 3.0.

  motivationalNarrative: |
    For decades, opening a business bank account has been a frustrating, slow process.
    Business owners fill out paperwork, wait for manual verification, make multiple
    branch visits, and lose 3-4 weeks before they can start banking. This release
    changes everything.

    We're not just digitizing forms—we're reimagining the entire experience. A sole
    proprietor can now open an account from their phone in under 15 minutes, with
    instant approval and immediate access to banking. A corporation working with a
    relationship manager benefits from digital workflows that eliminate paperwork
    and reduce wait times to 48 hours.

    This is about respect—respecting our customers' time and our employees' capabilities.
    We're using technology to handle repetitive verification tasks so our relationship
    managers can focus on advisory services and building relationships. We're meeting
    regulatory requirements faster and more consistently than ever before.

    Release 1.0 proves that a Tier 1 Canadian bank can move fast, innovate boldly, and
    deliver experiences that rival fintech startups—all while maintaining the security,
    compliance, and trustworthiness our customers expect. This is our digital foundation.
    Everything we build next depends on getting this right.
