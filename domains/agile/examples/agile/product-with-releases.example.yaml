  motivationalNarrative: |
    Commercial banking has been stuck in the past for too long. While consumers enjoy
    seamless digital banking, our business clients endure weeks of paperwork, manual
    processes, and frustrating experiences. CommercePay changes everything.

    We're building the platform that makes business banking as easy as consumer banking—
    with the security, compliance, and sophistication that businesses demand. Account
    opening in minutes, not weeks. Cash management at your fingertips. Integration with
    the tools businesses already use. Available 24/7, bilingual, mobile-first.

    This is about respect for our customers' time and our employees' expertise. We're
    automating the tedious work so our people can focus on advisory services and
    relationship building. We're meeting regulatory requirements faster and more
    consistently than ever before. We're showing the market that a Tier 1 Canadian bank
    can move fast and innovate boldly.

    CommercePay is our digital foundation. Every capability we build—from account opening
    to cash management to ecosystem integrations—makes us more competitive, more
    efficient, and more valuable to our clients. This is how we win the next decade of
    commercial banking.
