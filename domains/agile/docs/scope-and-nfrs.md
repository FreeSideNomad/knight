## Additional NFR Concepts

### non_functional_requirement

**Purpose**: Specifies quality attributes, constraints, and system-wide requirements that define how the system should behave rather than what it should do.

**Schema fields**:
- `nfr_id`: Unique identifier
- `category`: performance | security | scalability | usability | reliability | maintainability
- `description`: Detailed requirement statement
- `acceptance_criteria`: Measurable success criteria
- `related_features`: Features impacted by this NFR
- `quality_metric_refs`: References to QE quality metrics

**DDD Grounding:**
```
non_functional_requirement.quality_metric_refs → qe:quality_characteristics
```

**Example:**
```yaml
non_functional_requirement:
  nfr_id: nfr_api_response_time
  category: performance
  description: "All API endpoints must respond within 500ms at p95"
  acceptance_criteria:
    - metric: response_time_p95
      target: 500ms
      measurement: load_test
  related_features:
    - feature:job-search-api
    - feature:profile-retrieval
  quality_metric_refs:
    - qe:QualityCharacteristics:performance
```

**Job Seeker Example:**
```yaml
non_functional_requirement:
  nfr_id: nfr_matching_accuracy
  category: reliability
  description: "Job matching algorithm must achieve 85% relevance score"
  acceptance_criteria:
    - metric: match_relevance_score
      target: 0.85
      measurement: a_b_test
  related_features:
    - feature:intelligent-matching
  quality_metric_refs:
    - qe:QualityCharacteristics:accuracy
```

- `success_criteria`: Measurable outcomes
- `key_themes`: Strategic themes
- `target_users`: User segments targeted

**Example:**
```yaml
release_vision:
  vision_id: rv_q4_2025
  release_ref: release:2025-q4
  vision_statement: "Empower job seekers with AI-powered career guidance"
  success_criteria:
    - "50% adoption of AI career coach within 30 days"
    - "25% increase in successful job placements"
  key_themes:
    - AI-powered recommendations

```

### metadata

**Purpose**: Structured metadata for tracking, categorization, and reporting.

**Schema fields**:
- `created_at`: Creation timestamp
- `updated_at`: Last update timestamp

- `custom_fields`: Key-value pairs for domain-specific metadata

**Example:**
```yaml
user_story:
  id: story_profile_update
  title: "Update candidate profile"
  metadata:
    created_at: "2025-10-14T10:30:00Z"
    updated_at: "2025-10-14T15:45:00Z"
