## Common Questions

**Q: Do I need to know SAFe to understand this guide?**
A: No. The guide teaches SAFe concepts as needed. If you're using Scrum for a single team, focus on chapters 4-5, 7-8, 10.

**Q: Is this guide only for large organizations?**
A: No. Small teams can focus on Scrum chapters (4-7). The practices (TDD, flow, metrics) apply at any scale.

**Q: Can I skip the narrative and just read concept boxes?**
A: You can, but you'll miss context. The narrative shows why concepts matter and how they connect.

**Q: How technical do I need to be?**
A: Code examples appear in technical chapters (5, 10) but aren't required to understand concepts. Non-technical readers can focus on narrative.

**Q: What if my organization uses Kanban, not Scrum?**
A: Chapter 8 covers Kanban thoroughly. Many concepts (flow, WIP limits, cycle time) are Kanban-native. Skip sprint-specific content.

**Q: Is this guide prescriptive or descriptive?**
A: Both. It describes what CommercePay does and prescribes practices through concept boxes. Adapt to your context.

**Q: How often should I reference this guide?**
A: Keep it accessible. Reference it when planning sprints, facing challenges, or coaching others. It's a living reference, not a one-time read.
