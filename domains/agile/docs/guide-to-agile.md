## Introduction to Agile

### What is Agile?

Agile is a philosophy and set of principles for software development that emphasizes:

- **Iterative development**

  Building software in small increments

- **Collaboration**

  Working closely with customers and within teams

- **Flexibility**

  Responding to change over following a plan

- **Continuous improvement**

  Regularly reflecting and adapting

- **Working software**

  Delivering functional software frequently

Agile emerged in the early 2000s as a response to heavyweight, plan-driven methodologies (like Waterfall) that struggled with changing requirements and long feedback cycles.

### Why Agile?

Traditional software development approaches often resulted in:
- Late delivery of software
- Software that didn't meet user needs
- Inability to respond to changing requirements
- Long feedback cycles
- Low team morale

Agile addresses these issues by:
- Delivering working software frequently (weeks rather than months)
- Incorporating feedback continuously
- Embracing change as a competitive advantage
- Empowering teams to self-organize
- Focusing on individuals and interactions

## Real-World Case Study: CommercePay Platform

Throughout this guide, we'll illustrate agile concepts with a real-world case study: **CommercePay**, a digital commercial banking platform built by Sterling Financial Group, a Tier 1 Canadian bank.

This case study demonstrates how a large organization applies Scrum, SAFe, XP, and other agile practices to deliver complex software. You'll see real teams, real challenges, and real solutions.

*(For the complete case study foundation including business context, stakeholders, technology stack, and transformation journey, see Appendix A: CommercePay Case Study Foundation)*

## The Agile Manifesto

### Four Values

Published in 2001 by 17 software developers, the Agile Manifesto declares:

**We value:**

1. **Individuals and interactions** over processes and tools
2. **Working software** over comprehensive documentation
3. **Customer collaboration** over contract negotiation
4. **Responding to change** over following a plan

*Note: While there is value in the items on the right, we value the items on the left more.*

### Twelve Principles

1. **Customer Satisfaction**: Satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software
2. **Welcome Change**: Welcome changing requirements, even late in development
3. **Frequent Delivery**: Deliver working software frequently, from weeks to months, with preference for shorter timescales
4. **Collaboration**: Business people and developers must work together daily
5. **Motivated Individuals**: Build projects around motivated individuals, give them the environment and support they need
6. **Face-to-Face**: The most efficient method of conveying information is face-to-face conversation
7. **Working Software**: Working software is the primary measure of progress
8. **Sustainable Pace**: Agile processes promote sustainable development at a constant pace
9. **Technical Excellence**: Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design
10. **Simplicity**: The art of maximizing the amount of work not done
11. **Self-Organization**: The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams
12. **Reflection**: At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective and adjusts accordingly

- **Product:** What is it?
- **Business Goals:** Why do it?

**Elevator Pitch**

Template:
"For [target customer] who [statement of need], [product name] is a [product category] that [key benefit]. Unlike [alternatives], our product [differentiator]."

---

## Planning Practices

### User Story Writing

**Format:**
"As a [type of user], I want [goal] so that [benefit]."

**INVEST Criteria:**
- **Independent:** Can be developed separately
- **Negotiable:** Details can be discussed
- **Valuable:** Provides value to users
- **Estimable:** Can be estimated
- **Small:** Fits in a sprint
- **Testable:** Has clear acceptance criteria

**Example:**
```
As a customer
I want to reset my password via email
So that I can regain access if I forget it

Acceptance Criteria:
- User can request password reset from login page
- Email with reset link sent within 5 minutes
- Link expires after 24 hours
- Old password no longer works after reset
```

### Story Splitting

**When to Split:**
- Story too large for sprint
- Story has multiple acceptance criteria
- Story has unclear scope

**Splitting Patterns:**

1. **By Workflow Steps**
   - Split by user journey steps
   - Example: Register → Verify Email → Complete Profile

2. **By Business Rules**
   - Split by different scenarios
   - Example: Standard discount → Volume discount → Premium discount

3. **By Data Types**
   - Split by different entities
   - Example: Export customers → Export orders → Export products

4. **By Operations (CRUD)**
   - Create, Read, Update, Delete
   - Example: Add item → View items → Edit item → Delete item

5. **By Happy/Unhappy Paths**
   - Split success from error cases
   - Example: Successful payment → Failed payment

6. **By Complexity**
   - Split simple from complex
   - Example: Basic search → Advanced search with filters

### Estimation

**Story Points**
**Definition:** Relative measure of effort, complexity, and uncertainty

**Characteristics:**
- Relative (not absolute time)
- Include complexity, effort, uncertainty
- Team-specific
- Improve over time

**Common Scales:**
- Fibonacci: 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21
- Powers of 2: 1, 2, 4, 8, 16
- T-shirt: XS, S, M, L, XL

**Planning Poker**

**Process:**
1. Product Owner presents story
2. Team asks questions
3. Each person selects estimate card (privately)
4. All reveal simultaneously
5. Discuss differences (highest and lowest explain)
6. Re-estimate
7. Converge on estimate

**Benefits:**
- Engages entire team
- Surfaces assumptions
- Builds shared understanding
- Fun and engaging

### Prioritization

**MoSCoW**
- **Must Have:** Critical, non-negotiable
- **Should Have:** Important but not critical
- **Could Have:** Nice to have
- **Won't Have:** Out of scope

**Value vs. Effort**
- 2x2 matrix
- Quick wins: High value, low effort
- Big bets: High value, high effort
- Fill-ins: Low value, low effort
- Time sinks: Low value, high effort

**WSJF (see SAFe section)**

## Quality and Testing

### Testing Pyramid

**Structure:**

The Testing Pyramid shows the recommended distribution of test types in a healthy test suite, with more tests at the base (unit) and fewer at the top (manual).

| Test Type | Volume | Speed | Scope | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|--------|-------|---------|
| **Manual** | Few (as needed) | Slowest (hours) | Exploratory testing | Human judgment, usability testing, edge cases |
| **UI/E2E** | Fewest (dozens) | Slow (minutes) | Full user workflows | Test user journeys through the system |
| **Integration** | Fewer (hundreds) | Moderate (seconds) | Component interaction | Test interfaces between components |
| **Unit** | Most (thousands) | Fast (milliseconds) | Individual functions | Test isolated functions and methods |

**Unit Tests:**
- Test individual functions/methods in isolation
- Fast execution (milliseconds per test)
- Large volume (thousands of tests)
- Provide rapid feedback during development
- Form the foundation of the testing strategy

**Integration Tests:**
- Test component interaction and interfaces
- Moderate execution speed (seconds per test)
- Medium volume (hundreds of tests)
- Verify that components work together correctly
- Test API contracts and data flow

**UI/E2E Tests:**
- Test complete user workflows end-to-end
- Slower execution (minutes per test)
- Small volume (dozens of tests)
- Can be brittle due to UI changes
- Test critical user journeys

**Manual Tests:**
- Exploratory testing for discovery
- Usability testing with real users
- Edge cases and scenarios difficult to automate
- Require human judgment and intuition
- Complement automated tests

### Test-Driven Development (TDD)

**Red-Green-Refactor Cycle:**

1. **Red:** Write failing test
2. **Green:** Write minimal code to pass
3. **Refactor:** Improve design

**Benefits:**
- Tests first ensure testability
- Better design
- Complete coverage
- Living documentation
- Confidence

**Best Practices:**
- One test at a time
- Smallest step possible
- Refactor only when green
- Keep tests fast
