# Domain II: Testing Ontologies and Taxonomies

**Research Domain**: Testing Ontologies and Taxonomies
**Status**: Complete
**Last Updated**: 2025-10-04

---

## Overview

This document provides comprehensive coverage of testing ontologies—formal representations of testing knowledge that define concepts, relationships, and properties within the software testing domain. These ontologies provide structured vocabularies and conceptual frameworks for understanding and organizing testing knowledge.

**Covered Ontologies**:
1. ROoST (Reference Ontology on Software Testing)
2. TestTDO (Test Top-Domain Ontology)
3. STOWS (Software Testing Ontology for Web Services)
4. Work Product Types (WPT) Pattern

**Purpose**: Understanding these ontologies helps create consistent, standardized testing taxonomies that align with domain models (DDD) and user interface patterns (UX).

## 1. ROoST (Reference Ontology on Software Testing)

### 1.1 Overview

**Full Name**: Reference Ontology on Software Testing
**Source**: NEMO (Networked Ontology Model Engineering), Federal University of Espírito Santo, Brazil
**Website**: https://dev.nemo.inf.ufes.br/seon/ROoST.html
**Part of**: SEON (Software Engineering Ontology Network)
**Primary Authors**: Falbo, et al.

ROoST is a reference ontology that captures core software testing concepts and relationships. It was built by reusing ontology patterns from the Software Process Ontology Pattern Language (SP-OPL).

### 1.2 Five Sub-Ontologies

ROoST is organized into **five sub-ontologies**, each covering a specific aspect of software testing:

#### 1. Testing Artifacts Sub-Ontology

**Core Artifacts**:
- **Test Plan**: Roadmap for testing activities, defining scope, approach, resources, and schedule
- **Test Case**: Document with input data, expected results, testing conditions
- **Test Suite**: Collection of related test cases
- **Test Script**: Executable test implementation
- **Test Data**: Data used to execute tests
- **Test Result**: Actual outcomes from test execution
- **Test Report**: Summary and analysis of testing activities
- **Test Analysis Report**: Detailed analysis of test results
- **Incident Report**: Documentation of defects found

## 2. TestTDO (Test Top-Domain Ontology)

### 2.1 Overview

**Full Name**: Test Top-Domain Ontology
**Authors**: Tebes, Olsina, et al.
**Latest Version**: v1.3 (with mentions of v2.0 in development)
**Architecture**: FCD-OntoArch (Foundational, Core, and Domain Ontological Architecture)
**Foundation**: Built on SituationCO and ProcessCO core ontologies

TestTDO is a rigorous, formally-defined ontology for software testing built using a four-layered architecture approach.

### 2.2 Four-Layer Ontological Architecture

#### Layer 1: Foundational Level (Upper Ontology)
Basic ontological concepts that apply universally across domains:
- Entity
- Property
- Relationship
- Event
- Time
- Space

#### Layer 2: Core Level (Cross-Domain)
Concepts applicable to multiple domains:
- **SituationCO** (Situation Core Ontology): Contexts, states, conditions
- **ProcessCO** (Process Core Ontology): Activities, tasks, workflows

#### Layer 3: Domain Level (Testing-Specific)
Software testing domain concepts:
- Test activities
- Test artifacts
- Test roles
- Test techniques
- Test metrics

#### Layer 4: Instance Level
Specific instantiations and examples:
- Specific test cases
- Actual test results
- Concrete test environments

**Job Seeker Instantiation**:
```yaml
testtdo_layers_job_seeker:
  foundational:
    entities: Value Objects, Aggregates, Components, Pages
    events: Domain Events (evt_application_submitted)
    time: Test execution timestamps

  core:
    situation:
      - Test environment: Docker containers
      - Test context: bc_applications

    process:
      - CI/CD pipeline activities
      - Sprint testing workflow

  domain:
    test_activities:
      - Unit testing, Integration testing, E2E testing

    test_artifacts:
      - Test cases in YAML schema
      - Test results in Allure reports

    test_techniques:
      - BVA for vo_experience_years
      - State transition for agg_application

  instance:
    specific_test_case:
      id: tc_unit_001_vo_email_validation
      bounded_context: bc_profile
      value_object: vo_email
      result: Pass
      execution_time: 2025-10-04T10:30:00Z
```

### 2.3 Technical Composition

TestTDO includes:
- **43 defined terms** (concepts)
- **48 defined properties** (attributes of concepts)
- **36 defined non-taxonomic relationships** (connections between concepts)
- **14 axioms specified in first-order logic** (formal rules and constraints)

**Example Terms**:
- Test Activity
- Test Artifact
- Test Technique
- Test Metric
- Test Stakeholder
- Test Environment

**Example Properties**:
- hasName
- hasDescription
- hasExecutionDate
- hasResult
- hasCoverage

**Example Relationships**:
- executes (Tester executes TestCase)
- produces (TestExecution produces TestResult)
- usesData (TestCase usesData TestData)
- appliesTechnique (TestDesign appliesTechnique TestTechnique)

**Example Axiom** (First-Order Logic):
```
∀tc ∈ TestCase: ∃tr ∈ TestResult: executes(tc) → produces(tr)

"For all test cases, there exists a test result such that
executing the test case produces a test result."
```

### 2.4 Development Methodology

TestTDO was developed through:

1. **Systematic Literature Review (SLR)** on software testing ontologies
2. **Standards Analysis**: ISTQB, IEEE, ISO/IEC testing standards
3. **Core Ontology Extension**: Extending SituationCO and ProcessCO
4. **Formal Specification**: First-order logic axioms for precision
5. **Iterative Refinement**: Multiple versions (v1.1, v1.2, v1.3)

### 2.5 TestTDO Strengths and Limitations

**Strengths**:
- Rigorous formal foundation (first-order logic axioms)
- Clear layered architecture enables reuse and extension
- Built on proven core ontologies (SituationCO, ProcessCO)

## 8. Practical Application Guidelines

### 8.1 Choosing the Right Ontology

**Use ROoST when**:
- Need comprehensive process coverage
- Organizing testing activities and stakeholders
- Defining testing artifacts for documentation
- General-purpose testing approach

**Use TestTDO when**:
- Need formal precision and rigor
- Extending to domain-specific concepts
- Building ontology-based tools
- Academic or research context

**Use STOWS when**:
- Testing web applications (like Job Seeker)
- Need web-specific testing concepts
- Focusing on API and browser testing
- Practical web testing scenarios

**Use WPT when**:
- Organizing test artifacts
- Managing test work product lifecycle
- Classifying testing deliverables
- Documentation and archival

### 8.2 Combining Ontologies

For Job Seeker, we combine all four:

```yaml
combined_ontology_application:
  from_roost:
    - Process structure (5 sub-ontologies)
    - Stakeholder roles
    - Testing techniques

  from_testtdo:
    - Formal definitions and relationships
    - Layered architecture (foundational → domain → instance)
    - Extension mechanism for DDD/UX concepts

  from_stows:
    - Web-specific testing (browsers, APIs)
    - Compound concepts (Task, Capability)
    - Three-tier classification

  from_wpt:
    - Artifact organization (documents, software, code, information)
    - Lifecycle management
    - Bounded context-based organization
```
