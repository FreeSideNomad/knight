## 1. Test Strategy

### 1.1 Definition

**ISTQB Glossary Definition**:
> Test Strategy: A high-level description of the test levels to be performed and the testing within those levels for an organization or programme (one or more projects).

**ISO/IEC/IEEE 29119-2 Definition**:
> Test Strategy: Defines the overall approach to testing, including the test levels to be undertaken, the testing techniques to be applied, and the organizational test process to be adopted.

A test strategy is a high-level document that defines the overall approach to testing for an organization or project. It provides a blueprint for how testing will be conducted across all initiatives.

## 2. Test Plans

### 2.1 Definition

**ISTQB Glossary Definition**:
> Test Plan: Documentation describing the test objectives to be achieved and the means and the schedule for achieving them, organized to coordinate testing activities.

**IEEE 829 (Historical)**:
> Test Plan: A document describing the scope, approach, resources, and schedule of intended test activities. It identifies test items, features to be tested, testing tasks, who will do each task, and any risks requiring contingency planning.

A test plan is more detailed and tactical than a test strategy, focusing on how testing will be executed for a specific project, release, or bounded context.

### 2.2 Differences from Test Strategy

| Aspect | Test Strategy | Test Plan |
|--------|---------------|-----------|
| **Scope** | Organization or program-wide | Specific project or release |
| **Level** | High-level approach | Detailed execution plan |
| **Longevity** | Long-term (years) | Short-term (weeks to months) |
| **Focus** | What and why | How, when, who |
| **Audience** | Executives, all QA | Project team, testers |
| **Detail** | General principles | Specific tasks and schedules |
| **Updates** | Infrequent (annually) | Frequent (per sprint/release) |

**Analogy**:
- **Test Strategy** = War strategy (overall approach to winning)
- **Test Plan** = Battle plan (specific tactics for this engagement)

### 2.3 Components (IEEE 829 Standard)

The IEEE 829 standard (now superseded by ISO/IEC/IEEE 29119-3) specified these components:

#### 1. Test Plan Identifier

### 2.4 Agile/DevOps Approach to Test Plans

In Agile environments, traditional test plans are often replaced by:

**1. Living Documentation**
- Test plan as wiki page (constantly updated)
- BDD scenarios as executable documentation
- Test automation as documentation

**2. Lightweight Test Plans**
- One-page test approach document
- Focus on what's different from standard practices
- Reference organizational test strategy for common elements

**3. Iteration-based Planning**
- Test planning per sprint
- Test strategy at epic/feature level
- Continuous refinement

**Job Seeker Agile Test Plan Template**:
```yaml
agile_test_plan_bc_applications:
  epic: Application Tracking System
  bounded_context: bc_applications
  sprint_duration: 2 weeks
  team: Team Alpha

  # What's different from organizational test strategy?
  unique_approach:
    - Heavy focus on state transition testing (application status)
    - Cross-context integration with bc_profile, bc_job_catalog, bc_matching
    - Multi-step wizard requiring E2E coverage

  # What are we testing this sprint?
  sprint_scope:
    user_stories:
      - US-101: As a candidate, I can create a draft application
      - US-102: As a candidate, I can submit an application
      - US-103: As a candidate, I can view application status

    acceptance_criteria: (see BDD scenarios in code)

  # How will we test?
  test_approach:
    - TDD for Value Objects (vo_application_status)
    - Integration tests for agg_application
    - E2E tests for wf_submit_application
    - Accessibility testing (WCAG 2.2 AA)

  # Definition of Done
  dod:
    - All acceptance tests pass
    - >90% code coverage (domain layer)
    - Zero critical accessibility violations
    - Code reviewed and approved
    - Deployed to staging and verified

  # Risks this sprint
  risks:
    - Cross-context integration untested
      mitigation: Integration test suite, contract testing

  # Resources
  team:
    - 2 developers
    - 1 QA engineer (embedded)
    - 1 UX designer (part-time)
```

### 2.5 Test Planning in Continuous Delivery

In CD environments, test planning focuses on:

**Pipeline Design**:
```yaml
cd_test_pipeline:
  commit_stage:
    trigger: Every commit
    tests: Unit tests, linting
    duration: <5 min
    failure_action: Block PR

  acceptance_stage:
    trigger: PR merge
    tests: Integration tests, component tests
    duration: <15 min
    failure_action: Block deployment

  deployment_stage:
    trigger: Deploy to staging
    tests: E2E tests, smoke tests
    duration: <30 min
    failure_action: Rollback deployment

  production_monitoring:
    trigger: Deploy to production
    tests: Smoke tests, synthetic monitoring
    duration: Continuous
    failure_action: Alert, potential rollback
```

### 2.6 Risk Assessment in Test Planning

Risk-based testing allocates effort based on risk (likelihood Ã— impact):

**Job Seeker Risk Assessment**:
```yaml
risk_assessment_bc_applications:
  high_risk:
    - area: svc_app_submit_application (cross-context integration)
      likelihood: Medium
      impact: High
      risk_score: 8
      test_allocation: 30%
      coverage_target: ">95%"
      test_techniques:
        - Integration testing
        - Contract testing
        - Error scenario testing

    - area: Application status state transitions
      likelihood: Medium
      impact: High
      risk_score: 8
      test_allocation: 20%
      coverage_target: ">95%"
      test_techniques:
        - State transition testing
        - Decision table testing
        - Invalid transition testing

  medium_risk:
    - area: Application form validation
      likelihood: Low
      impact: Medium
      risk_score: 4
      test_allocation: 15%
      coverage_target: ">85%"
      test_techniques:
        - Boundary value analysis
        - Equivalence partitioning

    - area: Application auto-save
      likelihood: Medium
      impact: Medium
      risk_score: 6
      test_allocation: 10%
      coverage_target: ">80%"
      test_techniques:
        - Timer testing
        - Network interruption simulation

  low_risk:
    - area: Application list display
      likelihood: Low
      impact: Low
      risk_score: 2
      test_allocation: 5%
      coverage_target: ">70%"
      test_techniques:
        - Basic functional testing
        - Visual regression testing
```

**Risk-Based Test Allocation** (70-20-10 rule):
- 70% effort on high-risk areas
- 20% effort on medium-risk areas
- 10% effort on low-risk areas

## 3. Test Scenarios

### 3.1 Definition

**ISTQB Glossary Definition**:
> Test Scenario: A sequence of test cases or test procedures, or both, that together form a test for an overall requirement or function.

**Alternative Definition**:
> Test Scenario: A high-level description of what to test, often from a user's perspective, without specifying the exact steps or test data.

A test scenario is a narrative description of what will be tested. It's more abstract than a test case, focusing on the "what" rather than the "how."

**Characteristics**:
- High-level (less detailed than test case)
- User-centric (describes user goals)
- Can map to multiple test cases
- Often written in business language
- Used for test planning and estimation

### 3.2 How to Write Effective Test Scenarios

#### Format 1: User Story Format
```
As a [role], I want to [action], so that [benefit]
```

**Job Seeker Examples**:
```yaml
test_scenarios_user_story_format:
  - scenario: "As a job seeker, I want to submit an application for a job posting, so that I can be considered for the position"

  - scenario: "As a job seeker, I want to track my application status, so that I know the progress of my application"

  - scenario: "As a job seeker, I want to withdraw my application, so that I'm no longer considered for the position"

  - scenario: "As a job seeker, I want my application to auto-save, so that I don't lose my progress if I navigate away"
```

#### Format 2: Scenario Name + Description
```
Scenario: [Clear, descriptive name]
Description: [What will be tested and expected outcome]
```

**Job Seeker Examples**:
```yaml
test_scenarios_descriptive:
  - scenario: "Successful Application Submission"
    description: "Verify that a candidate can create, complete, and submit an application, resulting in confirmation and status update to 'Submitted'"

  - scenario: "Application Form Validation"
    description: "Verify that the application form validates all required fields and displays appropriate error messages for invalid inputs"

  - scenario: "Application Status Transitions"
    description: "Verify that application status correctly transitions through states: Draft â†’ Submitted â†’ Under Review â†’ Accepted/Rejected"

  - scenario: "Cross-Context Data Integration"
    description: "Verify that application correctly pulls candidate profile data and job posting details"
```

#### Format 3: BDD Gherkin Format (Executable)
```gherkin
Scenario: [Name]
  Given [preconditions]
  When [action]
  Then [expected result]
```

**Job Seeker Examples**:
```gherkin
Scenario: Submit Application for Job Posting
  Given I am a logged-in candidate
  And I have a complete profile
  And I am viewing a job posting I haven't applied to
  When I click "Apply Now"
  And I complete the application wizard
  And I click "Submit Application"
  Then I see a confirmation message
  And the application status is "Submitted"
  And I receive a confirmation email
  And the evt_application_submitted event is published

Scenario: Application Form Auto-Save
  Given I am on the application wizard
  And I have filled in some fields
  When 30 seconds elapse
  Then the application is auto-saved as a draft
  And I see a "Draft saved" notification

Scenario: Prevent Duplicate Application
  Given I am a logged-in candidate
  And I have already submitted an application for job posting "Software Engineer"
  When I try to apply again for the same job posting
  Then I see a message "You have already applied for this position"
  And the Apply button is disabled
```

### 3.3 Relationship to Requirements and User Stories

**Traceability Mapping**:
```yaml
requirements_to_scenarios_mapping:
  requirement: REQ-APP-001
  title: "Candidate can submit job application"

  user_story: US-102
  story: "As a candidate, I can submit an application for a job posting"

  test_scenarios:
    - TS-102-01: Successful application submission
    - TS-102-02: Application submission with missing required fields
    - TS-102-03: Application submission for already applied job
    - TS-102-04: Application submission when not logged in
    - TS-102-05: Application submission with file attachments

  test_cases:
    TS-102-01:
      - TC-102-01-01: Submit application with all required fields
      - TC-102-01-02: Submit application with optional fields
      - TC-102-01-03: Verify evt_application_submitted event
      - TC-102-01-04: Verify confirmation email sent

    TS-102-02:
      - TC-102-02-01: Submit with missing cover letter
      - TC-102-02-02: Submit with missing resume
      - TC-102-02-03: Verify validation error messages
```

**Requirements Traceability Matrix (RTM)**:
```yaml
rtm_bc_applications:
  - requirement_id: REQ-APP-001
    title: Submit application
    test_scenarios: [TS-102-01, TS-102-02, TS-102-03]
    test_cases: [TC-102-01-01, TC-102-01-02, TC-102-02-01]
    status: Verified
    coverage: 100%

  - requirement_id: REQ-APP-002
    title: Track application status
    test_scenarios: [TS-103-01, TS-103-02]
    test_cases: [TC-103-01-01, TC-103-01-02]
    status: In Progress
    coverage: 80%

  - requirement_id: REQ-APP-003
    title: Withdraw application
    test_scenarios: [TS-104-01]
    test_cases: [TC-104-01-01, TC-104-01-02]
    status: Not Started
    coverage: 0%
```

### 3.4 Scenario-Based Testing Approaches

#### Use Case Testing

Map test scenarios to use cases:

```yaml
use_case_testing_application_submission:
  use_case: UC-APP-001 Submit Application

  primary_actor: Job Seeker (Candidate)

  preconditions:
    - User is authenticated
    - User has a complete profile
    - Job posting is active and accepting applications

  main_success_scenario:
    1: User navigates to job posting detail page
    2: User clicks "Apply Now" button
    3: System displays application wizard (Step 1: Review Profile)
    4: User reviews and confirms profile information
    5: User proceeds to Step 2 (Cover Letter and Resume)
    6: User uploads/edits cover letter and resume
    7: User proceeds to Step 3 (Review and Submit)
    8: User reviews application summary
    9: User clicks "Submit Application"
    10: System validates application
    11: System creates agg_application in "Submitted" status
    12: System publishes evt_application_submitted event
    13: System displays confirmation page
    14: System sends confirmation email

  test_scenarios_mapping:
    - TS-UC-001-01: Happy path (main success scenario)
    - TS-UC-001-02: Alternative flow - user edits profile during application
    - TS-UC-001-03: Alternative flow - user saves draft and completes later
    - TS-UC-001-04: Exception flow - validation errors
    - TS-UC-001-05: Exception flow - duplicate application attempt
    - TS-UC-001-06: Exception flow - job posting closed during application
```

#### Context-Scenario-Action Pattern

Organize scenarios by context:

```yaml
context_scenario_action:
  context: Application Submission Workflow

  scenarios:
    - scenario: First-time application
      actions:
        - Navigate to job posting
        - Click Apply
        - Complete wizard steps
        - Submit application
      expected: Application created, confirmation shown

    - scenario: Resume incomplete application draft
      actions:
        - Navigate to My Applications
        - Click "Continue Application" on draft
        - Complete remaining steps
        - Submit application
      expected: Draft updated to Submitted, confirmation shown

    - scenario: Application with custom cover letter
      actions:
        - Start application
        - Upload custom cover letter file
        - Provide additional notes
        - Submit application
      expected: Cover letter attached, visible in application summary
```

### 3.5 Best Practices for Test Scenarios

1. **User-Centric Language**: Write from user's perspective
2. **Clear and Concise**: One clear goal per scenario
3. **Traceable**: Link to requirements/user stories
4. **Independent**: Each scenario should stand alone
5. **Testable**: Should be verifiable with clear pass/fail
6. **Complete**: Cover happy path and alternative/exception flows
7. **Realistic**: Represent actual user behavior

**Anti-Patterns to Avoid**:
- Too vague ("Test the application feature")
- Too detailed (becomes a test case)
- Testing implementation instead of behavior
- No clear expected outcome
- Mixing multiple unrelated scenarios

### 3.6 DDD Integration: Scenarios by Bounded Context

```yaml
test_scenarios_by_bounded_context:
  bc_applications:
    aggregate: agg_application
    scenarios:
      - Create draft application
      - Submit application
      - Track application status
      - Withdraw application
      - Update submitted application (if allowed)
      - Application status transitions (state machine)

  bc_profile:
    aggregate: agg_candidate_profile
    scenarios:
      - Create candidate profile
      - Update profile information
      - Add/remove skills
      - Upload resume
      - Set job preferences

  bc_job_catalog:
    aggregate: agg_job_posting
    scenarios:
      - Search jobs by keyword
      - Filter jobs by location
      - Filter jobs by experience level
      - View job posting details
      - Save job posting to favorites

  bc_matching:
    aggregate: agg_match_score
    scenarios:
      - Calculate match score for candidate-job pair
      - Retrieve top matches for candidate
      - Retrieve top candidates for job posting
      - Update match score when profile changes

  # Cross-Context Scenarios
  cross_context:
    - scenario: Submit application (bc_applications + bc_profile + bc_job_catalog)
      description: Application pulls data from Profile and Job Catalog

    - scenario: Match score updates on profile change (bc_profile + bc_matching)
      description: Profile update triggers match score recalculation
```

### 3.7 UX Integration: Scenarios by Workflow

```yaml
test_scenarios_by_workflow:
  wf_submit_application:
    description: Complete application submission workflow
    pages: [page_job_detail, page_application_wizard, page_application_confirmation]

    scenarios:
      - TS-WF-APP-01: Happy path application submission
        steps:
          - View job posting
          - Click Apply
          - Navigate wizard (3 steps)
          - Submit application
          - View confirmation

      - TS-WF-APP-02: Application with validation errors
        steps:
          - Start application
          - Skip required fields
          - Attempt to proceed
          - See validation errors
          - Correct errors
          - Submit successfully

      - TS-WF-APP-03: Application save as draft
        steps:
          - Start application
          - Fill partial information
          - Click "Save Draft"
          - Navigate away
          - Return later
          - Continue from saved draft

      - TS-WF-APP-04: Application auto-save
        steps:
          - Start application
          - Fill some fields
          - Wait 30 seconds
          - See auto-save notification
          - Verify draft saved (refresh page)

  wf_create_profile:
    description: New candidate profile creation
    pages: [page_signup, page_profile_wizard, page_profile_summary]

    scenarios:
      - TS-WF-PROF-01: Complete profile creation
      - TS-WF-PROF-02: Profile creation with validation errors
      - TS-WF-PROF-03: Profile creation with resume upload

  wf_job_search:
    description: Job search and filtering
    pages: [page_job_search, page_job_detail]

    scenarios:

### 4.5 Test Case Example (BDD Format - Automated)

```gherkin
Feature: Application Submission
  As a job seeker
  I want to submit applications for job postings
  So that I can be considered for positions

  Background:
    Given I am logged in as candidate "john.doe@example.com"
    And my profile is complete
    And job posting "Software Engineer" with id "job-123" exists

  @critical @automated
  Scenario: Submit application with valid data
    Given I have not applied for job "job-123"
    When I navigate to job posting "job-123"
    Then I should see the "Apply Now" button enabled

    When I click "Apply Now"
    Then I should see the application wizard step "Review Profile"

    When I click "Next"
    Then I should see the application wizard step "Cover Letter and Resume"

    When I enter cover letter "I am excited to apply for this position..."
    And I upload resume file "john_doe_resume.pdf"
    And I click "Next"
    Then I should see the application wizard step "Review and Submit"
    And I should see profile information summary
    And I should see cover letter preview
    And I should see resume file name "john_doe_resume.pdf"

    When I click "Submit Application"
    Then I should see confirmation message "Application submitted successfully"
    And I should see application ID
    And the evt_application_submitted event should be published with:
      | candidate_id | job_posting_id | status    |
      | cand-001     | job-123        | Submitted |

    When I navigate to "My Applications"
    Then I should see application for "Software Engineer" with status "Submitted"
    And the application submitted date should be today

  @high @automated
  Scenario: Submit application with missing required fields
    Given I have not applied for job "job-123"
    When I navigate to job posting "job-123"
    And I click "Apply Now"
    And I navigate through steps without filling required fields
    And I click "Submit Application"
    Then I should see validation error "Cover letter is required"
    And I should see validation error "Resume is required"
    And the application should NOT be submitted
    And no evt_application_submitted event should be published

  @high @automated
  Scenario: Attempt to apply for already applied job
    Given I have already submitted application for job "job-123"
    When I navigate to job posting "job-123"
    Then I should see message "You have already applied for this position"
    And the "Apply Now" button should be disabled
```

### 4.6 Test Case Design Best Practices

#### 1. Follow the Single Responsibility Principle
Each test case should test ONE thing:

**Good**:
```yaml
- TC-001: Submit application with valid data
- TC-002: Submit application with missing cover letter
- TC-003: Submit application with invalid resume format
```

**Bad**:
```yaml
- TC-001: Submit application and track status and withdraw
  (Tests multiple features - should be separate test cases)
```

#### 2. Use Clear, Descriptive Names
Test case name should clearly state what is being tested:

**Good**:
- "Submit application with all required fields populated"
- "Verify validation error when email is missing"
- "Verify application status transitions from Draft to Submitted"

**Bad**:
- "Test 1"
- "Check application"
- "Validation test"

#### 3. Make Tests Independent
Each test should run independently without relying on others:

**Good**:
```yaml
test_case_1:
  preconditions:
    - User logged in
    - Fresh test data created
  cleanup:
    - Delete test data after execution

test_case_2:
  preconditions:
    - User logged in
    - Fresh test data created
  cleanup:
    - Delete test data after execution
```

**Bad**:
```yaml
test_case_1:
  action: Create application (app-001)

test_case_2:
  precondition: Test case 1 has run
  action: Update application (app-001)
```

#### 4. Use Equivalence Partitioning and Boundary Value Analysis

**Equivalence Partitioning Example (vo_experience_years)**:
```yaml
test_cases_experience_years:
  valid_partitions:
    - TC-EXP-001: Experience = 0 years (entry level)
    - TC-EXP-002: Experience = 3 years (mid-level)
    - TC-EXP-003: Experience = 10 years (senior)

  invalid_partitions:
    - TC-EXP-004: Experience = -1 (negative, invalid)
    - TC-EXP-005: Experience = "abc" (non-numeric, invalid)
    - TC-EXP-006: Experience = 101 (unrealistic, invalid)
```

**Boundary Value Analysis Example (file upload size)**:
```yaml
test_cases_file_upload_bva:
  boundary: Maximum file size = 5 MB = 5242880 bytes

  test_cases:
    - TC-FILE-001: Upload file with size = 0 bytes (minimum - 1, invalid)
    - TC-FILE-002: Upload file with size = 1 byte (minimum, valid)
    - TC-FILE-003: Upload file with size = 2621440 bytes (typical, valid)
    - TC-FILE-004: Upload file with size = 5242880 bytes (maximum, valid)
    - TC-FILE-005: Upload file with size = 5242881 bytes (maximum + 1, invalid)
```

#### 5. Cover Positive and Negative Scenarios

**Positive (Happy Path)**:
```yaml
- TC-POS-001: Submit application with valid data â†’ Success
- TC-POS-002: Update profile with valid email â†’ Updated
```

**Negative (Error Cases)**:
```yaml
- TC-NEG-001: Submit application without cover letter â†’ Validation error
- TC-NEG-002: Update profile with invalid email format â†’ Error message
- TC-NEG-003: Submit application for closed job posting â†’ Error "Job posting no longer accepting applications"
```

#### 6. Use Decision Tables for Complex Logic

**Example: Application Eligibility Rules**
```yaml
decision_table_application_eligibility:
  conditions:
    - User authenticated: [Y, Y, Y, Y, N, N, N, N]
    - Profile complete: [Y, Y, N, N, Y, Y, N, N]
    - Job active: [Y, N, Y, N, Y, N, Y, N]

  actions:
    - Allow application: [Y, N, N, N, N, N, N, N]
    - Show error: [N, Y, Y, Y, Y, Y, Y, Y]
    - Error message:
        - null
        - "Job posting is no longer active"
        - "Please complete your profile first"
        - "Job posting is no longer active"
        - "Please log in to apply"
        - "Please log in to apply"
        - "Please log in to apply"
        - "Please log in to apply"

test_cases_from_decision_table:
  - TC-DT-001: [Y, Y, Y] â†’ Allow application
  - TC-DT-002: [Y, Y, N] â†’ Show error "Job posting is no longer active"
  - TC-DT-003: [Y, N, Y] â†’ Show error "Please complete your profile first"
  - TC-DT-004: [Y, N, N] â†’ Show error "Job posting is no longer active"
  - TC-DT-005: [N, Y, Y] â†’ Show error "Please log in to apply"
  - TC-DT-006: [N, Y, N] â†’ Show error "Please log in to apply"
  - TC-DT-007: [N, N, Y] â†’ Show error "Please log in to apply"
  - TC-DT-008: [N, N, N] â†’ Show error "Please log in to apply"
```

#### 7. Use State Transition Testing for State Machines

**Application Status State Machine**:
```yaml
state_transition_application_status:
  states: [Draft, Submitted, Under Review, Interviewing, Offered, Accepted, Rejected, Withdrawn]

  valid_transitions:
    Draft:
      - [submit] â†’ Submitted
      - [delete] â†’ (deleted)

    Submitted:
      - [review] â†’ Under Review
      - [withdraw] â†’ Withdrawn

    Under Review:
      - [schedule_interview] â†’ Interviewing
      - [reject] â†’ Rejected

    Interviewing:
      - [make_offer] â†’ Offered
      - [reject] â†’ Rejected

    Offered:
      - [accept] â†’ Accepted
      - [reject] â†’ Rejected

    Accepted: (terminal state)
    Rejected: (terminal state)
    Withdrawn: (terminal state)

  test_cases_valid_transitions:
    - TC-ST-001: Draft â†’ submit â†’ Submitted
    - TC-ST-002: Submitted â†’ review â†’ Under Review
    - TC-ST-003: Under Review â†’ schedule_interview â†’ Interviewing
    - TC-ST-004: Interviewing â†’ make_offer â†’ Offered
    - TC-ST-005: Offered â†’ accept â†’ Accepted

  test_cases_invalid_transitions:
    - TC-ST-INV-001: Draft â†’ make_offer â†’ (should fail)
    - TC-ST-INV-002: Accepted â†’ withdraw â†’ (should fail, terminal state)
    - TC-ST-INV-003: Rejected â†’ review â†’ (should fail, terminal state)
```

  # Description
  summary: |
    When submitting an application with special characters (Ã©, Ã±, Ã¼, Ã§, etc.) in the
    cover letter field, the characters are not stored or displayed correctly. They
    appear as mojibake (ï¿½ or other incorrect characters).

  steps_to_reproduce:
    - step: 1
      action: Log in as candidate
    - step: 2
      action: Navigate to job posting and click "Apply Now"
    - step: 3
      action: In application wizard Step 2, enter cover letter with text "RÃ©sumÃ© for cafÃ© position"
    - step: 4
      action: Complete wizard and submit application
    - step: 5
      action: View submitted application or check database

  expected_result: |
    Cover letter displays correctly: "RÃ©sumÃ© for cafÃ© position"
    Characters Ã© and Ã© are preserved.

  actual_result: |
    Cover letter displays incorrectly: "Rï¿½sumï¿½ for cafï¿½ position"
    Special characters replaced with ï¿½ (replacement character).

  # Analysis
  root_cause: |
    Database column `applications.cover_letter` is using latin1 charset instead of
    utf8mb4. Special characters outside ASCII range are corrupted on insert.

  proposed_fix: |
    ALTER TABLE applications MODIFY cover_letter TEXT CHARACTER SET utf8mb4 COLLATE utf8mb4_unicode_ci;
    Ensure all text columns use utf8mb4 for full Unicode support.

#### Defect Severity vs Priority

**Severity** = Technical impact (how bad is the bug?)
**Priority** = Business impact (how urgently must it be fixed?)

Examples:
```yaml
defect_classification_examples:
  - scenario: Login page crashes (no one can log in)
    severity: Critical
    priority: Critical
    reason: Blocks all users, must fix immediately

  - scenario: Special characters corrupted in cover letter
    severity: High
    priority: High
    reason: Major feature broken, affects user data

  - scenario: Spelling error in help text
    severity: Low
    priority: Low
    reason: Cosmetic, no functional impact

  - scenario: Critical security vulnerability in admin panel (only 2 admins)
    severity: Critical
    priority: High
    reason: Severe technical issue, but limited user impact

  - scenario: CEO's favorite feature has minor cosmetic issue
    severity: Low
    priority: High
    reason: Low technical impact, but high business priority
```

## 8. Standards Alignment

### 8.1 ISTQB Test Documentation

All artifacts align with ISTQB Foundation Level v4.0 concepts:
- Test work products (test plan, test case, test report)
- Test monitoring and control
- Test completion activities

### 8.2 IEEE 829 / ISO/IEC/IEEE 29119-3

Document templates follow ISO/IEC/IEEE 29119-3 (which supersedes IEEE 829):
- Test Plan structure (16 components)
- Test Case specification
- Test Incident Report (defect report)
- Test Summary Report

### 8.3 ISO 25010 Quality Characteristics

Test artifacts reference ISO 25010 quality characteristics:
- Functional suitability (functional tests)
- Performance efficiency (performance tests)
- Usability (usability tests, accessibility tests)
- Security (security tests)

## 9. Best Practices Summary

### Test Strategy
1. Create organizational strategy for consistency
2. Create project strategy for unique needs
3. Align with DDD bounded contexts
4. Include shift-left and continuous testing
5. Define quality gates and metrics

### Test Plans
1. Follow IEEE 829 / ISO 29119-3 structure
2. Be specific and detailed
3. Include risk assessment
4. Define entry/exit criteria
5. Keep lightweight in Agile environments

### Test Scenarios
1. Write from user perspective
2. Use BDD format for clarity
3. Map to requirements/user stories
4. Cover happy path and edge cases
5. Organize by workflow or bounded context

### Test Cases
1. One test case = one test objective
2. Use clear, descriptive names
3. Make tests independent and repeatable
4. Apply test design techniques (BVA, EP, etc.)
5. Automate where ROI is positive

### Test Execution
1. Prepare environment and data
2. Log all results (pass/fail, actual results)
3. Capture evidence (screenshots, logs)
4. Report defects immediately
5. Integrate with CI/CD for continuous execution

### Test Reports
1. Tailor to audience (executives vs testers)
2. Include metrics and trends
3. Provide clear recommendations
4. Document lessons learned
5. Maintain traceability (requirements â†’ tests â†’ defects)
