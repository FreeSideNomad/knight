# Domain VII: Test Approaches and Methodologies

## Overview
This document explores modern test approaches and methodologies that define when, how, and where testing activities occur in the software development lifecycle. These approaches represent strategic frameworks that guide testing efforts, from early development phases (shift-left) to production monitoring (shift-right), and encompass various philosophies including risk-based prioritization, exploratory investigation, and development-driven test practices.

---

## 1. Shift-Left Testing

### Definition
Shift-Left Testing is an approach that emphasizes moving testing activities earlier in the software development lifecycle (SDLC). The term "shift-left" refers to moving testing activities to the left side of a traditional timeline diagram, meaning earlier phases of development.

**ISTQB Definition**: "An approach where testing is performed earlier in the lifecycle (e.g., not waiting for code to be implemented or for components to be integrated)."

### Core Principles
- **Early Defect Detection**: Find and fix defects as close to their introduction as possible
- **Prevention Over Detection**: Focus on preventing defects rather than just finding them
- **Test Design Early**: Create test cases during requirements and design phases
- **Collaboration**: Developers, testers, and business stakeholders work together from the start
- **Continuous Feedback**: Rapid feedback loops to address issues immediately
- **Static Testing First**: Use reviews, inspections, and static analysis before dynamic testing

### When to Use
- **New product development** where requirements are being defined
- **Agile/DevOps environments** with frequent iterations
- **Projects with high quality requirements** where defect prevention is critical
- **Complex systems** where late-stage defect fixes are expensive
- **Regulated industries** where compliance must be built in from the start
- **Teams with mature collaboration** between developers and testers

### Benefits
- **Cost Reduction**: Fixing defects early is significantly cheaper (10-100x less expensive)
- **Improved Quality**: Better architecture and design through early testing input
- **Faster Time-to-Market**: Fewer delays from late-stage defect discovery
- **Better Requirements**: Testing perspective improves requirement clarity and testability
- **Reduced Technical Debt**: Issues addressed before they become embedded in the codebase
- **Enhanced Collaboration**: Breaks down silos between development and testing
- **Risk Mitigation**: Critical issues identified before significant investment

### Challenges
- **Cultural Change**: Requires shift in mindset from "testing after development"
- **Skills Gap**: Developers need testing skills; testers need development knowledge
- **Tool Investment**: May require new tools for static analysis, test automation, etc.
- **Initial Overhead**: More time spent in early phases can feel like slower progress
- **Measurement Difficulty**: Traditional metrics may not capture shift-left benefits
- **Resistance**: Teams comfortable with traditional approaches may resist change
- **Resource Allocation**: Requires testers available during early project phases

### Job Seeker Application Examples

#### Example 1: Requirements Review and Testability Analysis
```markdown
**Scenario**: Product team drafts user story for job search functionality

**Shift-Left Activity**:
- QE participates in backlog refinement sessions
- Reviews acceptance criteria for completeness and testability
- Identifies ambiguities: "What does 'relevant jobs' mean?"
- Proposes testable criteria: location radius, skills match %, experience level
- Creates test conditions before development starts

**Outcome**: Requirements refined with clear, measurable acceptance criteria
```

#### Example 2: API Contract Testing During Design
```markdown
**Scenario**: Designing new job recommendation API

**Shift-Left Activity**:
- QE collaborates on API contract definition
- Creates contract tests using tools like Pact
- Identifies edge cases: user with no search history, empty results
- Validates error response schemas before implementation
- Runs contract tests against mock services

**Outcome**: API design validated; contract issues caught before coding
```

#### Example 3: Static Code Analysis Integration
```markdown
**Scenario**: Application profile management module development

**Shift-Left Activity**:
- Configure SonarQube with project-specific quality gates
- Set rules for code complexity, duplication, security vulnerabilities
- Integrate analysis into pre-commit hooks
- Review static analysis results during code review
- Address code smells before merge

**Outcome**: Code quality issues prevented from entering main branch
```

#### Example 4: Test Data Strategy Planning
```markdown
**Scenario**: Building feature for tracking job applications

**Shift-Left Activity**:
- QE designs test data strategy during sprint planning
- Creates data models for various application states
- Identifies privacy/GDPR considerations early

## 2. Shift-Right Testing

### Definition
Shift-Right Testing is an approach that extends testing activities beyond traditional pre-production phases into production environments. It focuses on validating system behavior with real users, real data, and real infrastructure to gain insights impossible to obtain in test environments.

**Industry Definition**: "Testing in production or production-like environments to validate real-world behavior, performance, and user experience with actual users and data."

### Core Principles
- **Production Validation**: Test with real users, data, and infrastructure
- **Continuous Monitoring**: Observe system behavior in real-time
- **Progressive Delivery**: Use feature flags, canary releases, A/B testing
- **Feedback-Driven**: Learn from production data to improve testing strategy
- **Graceful Degradation**: Design for failure and test recovery mechanisms
- **Observability First**: Instrument systems for visibility into production behavior
- **User-Centric**: Focus on actual user experience and outcomes

### When to Use
- **Microservices architectures** where component interactions are complex
- **Cloud-native applications** with dynamic infrastructure
- **User experience validation** requiring real user behavior data
- **Performance testing** needing production-scale load patterns
- **Feature experimentation** through A/B testing or beta programs
- **Systems with unpredictable usage patterns** that can't be simulated
- **Continuous deployment pipelines** with frequent releases

### Benefits
- **Real-World Validation**: Tests reflect actual user behavior and environment
- **Performance Insights**: Identify issues only visible at production scale
- **User Experience Data**: Gather metrics on actual user satisfaction and behavior
- **Faster Feedback**: Immediate insight into feature effectiveness
- **Risk Mitigation**: Progressive rollouts limit blast radius of issues
- **Cost Efficiency**: Production infrastructure used for both running and testing
- **Competitive Advantage**: Rapid experimentation and feature validation

### Challenges
- **Risk Management**: Testing in production carries inherent risks
- **Data Privacy**: Must handle real user data carefully (GDPR, compliance)
- **Blast Radius**: Issues can impact real users if not controlled
- **Complexity**: Requires sophisticated tooling and monitoring
- **Cultural Resistance**: "Testing in production" can seem risky or unprofessional
- **Cost**: Comprehensive monitoring and observability tools can be expensive
- **Skills Required**: Requires expertise in production systems, monitoring, incident response

### Job Seeker Application Examples

#### Example 1: Feature Flag-Based Progressive Rollout
```markdown
**Scenario**: New AI-powered resume optimization feature

**Shift-Right Activity**:
- Deploy feature behind feature flag (LaunchDarkly, Split.io)
- Enable for 5% of users initially (canary release)
- Monitor success metrics: feature usage, error rates, performance
- Gradually increase to 25%, 50%, 100% based on metrics
- Maintain kill switch for immediate rollback

**Metrics Monitored**:
- Feature adoption rate
- API response times (p50, p95, p99)
- Error rates and types
- User engagement metrics
- Resume optimization completion rate

**Outcome**: Safe, data-driven feature rollout with minimal user impact risk
```

#### Example 2: A/B Testing Job Matching Algorithm
```markdown
**Scenario**: Testing new job recommendation algorithm

**Shift-Right Activity**:
- Create A/B test: 50% users see old algorithm, 50% see new
- Define success metrics: click-through rate, application rate, time-to-apply
- Run test for 2 weeks with 10,000+ users per variant
- Analyze statistical significance of results
- Choose winning variant based on data

**Results**:
- Variant A (old): 12% click-through, 3% application rate
- Variant B (new): 15% click-through, 4.2% application rate
- Decision: Roll out new algorithm to all users

**Outcome**: Data-driven decision validated with real user behavior
```

#### Example 3: Synthetic Transaction Monitoring
```markdown
**Scenario**: Monitor critical user journeys in production

**Shift-Right Activity**:
- Create synthetic users that perform key workflows every 5 minutes
- Monitor job search flow: search → results → job details → apply
- Monitor application tracking: view applications → check status
- Alert on failures or performance degradation
- Track success rates and response times

**Synthetic Transactions**:
1. Search for "software engineer" in "San Francisco"
2. View first 3 job results
3. Click "Apply" on suitable job
4. Complete application form
5. Verify application appears in "My Applications"

**Outcome**: 24/7 validation of critical paths with real-time alerting
```

#### Example 4: Chaos Engineering Experiments
```markdown
**Scenario**: Validate resilience of job application submission service

**Shift-Right Activity**:
- Use Chaos Monkey to randomly terminate service instances
- Simulate database connection failures
- Introduce network latency to dependent services
- Monitor system recovery and user impact
- Verify graceful degradation: applications queued, not lost

**Hypothesis**: Application service can tolerate 50% instance failure with <1s latency increase

**Results**:
- Service maintained 99.9% availability
- Average latency increased 0.3s
- No data loss; all applications processed
- Auto-scaling triggered correctly

**Outcome**: Validated resilience; identified recovery time optimization
```

## 4. Risk-Based Testing

### Definition
Risk-Based Testing (RBT) is a testing approach where testing efforts are prioritized based on the assessment of risk. It focuses testing resources on areas of the application with the highest probability of failure and the most severe potential impact, ensuring efficient use of limited testing time and resources.

**ISTQB Definition**: "Testing approach in which the test strategy is determined by risk analysis. The goal is to reduce the level of product risks and inform stakeholders of their status."

### Core Principles
- **Risk Identification**: Systematically identify potential risks
- **Risk Analysis**: Assess likelihood and impact of each risk
- **Risk Prioritization**: Rank risks to guide testing focus
- **Risk-Based Test Design**: Create tests targeting high-risk areas
- **Adaptive Testing**: Adjust strategy as risks evolve
- **Stakeholder Communication**: Keep stakeholders informed of risk status
- **Resource Optimization**: Allocate testing effort proportional to risk
- **Residual Risk**: Accept and document low-priority risks

### Risk Assessment Framework
```markdown
**Risk Level = Likelihood × Impact**

**Likelihood Scale (1-5)**:
1. Rare: <5% probability
2. Unlikely: 5-25%
3. Possible: 25-50%
4. Likely: 50-75%
5. Almost Certain: >75%

**Impact Scale (1-5)**:
1. Minimal: Minor inconvenience, no business impact
2. Minor: Small business impact, workaround available
3. Moderate: Significant impact on subset of users
4. Major: Significant impact on all users or business
5. Catastrophic: Complete system failure, data loss, legal issues

**Risk Matrix**:
                Impact
           1    2    3    4    5
        1  L    L    L    M    M
Like.   2  L    L    M    M    H
        3  L    M    M    H    H
        4  M    M    H    H    C
        5  M    H    H    C    C

L = Low (Accept risk, minimal testing)
M = Medium (Monitor, moderate testing)
H = High (Mitigate, extensive testing)
C = Critical (Prevent, exhaustive testing)
```

### When to Use
- **Limited testing resources** requiring prioritization
- **Complex systems** with many potential failure points
- **Projects with tight deadlines** needing focused testing
- **Safety-critical systems** where failures have severe consequences
- **Legacy systems** with known problem areas
- **Regulated industries** requiring documented risk management
- **Continuous deployment** where comprehensive testing isn't feasible

### Benefits
- **Efficient Resource Use**: Testing effort focused where it matters most
- **Better Coverage**: High-risk areas receive appropriate attention
- **Stakeholder Alignment**: Transparent, business-driven testing priorities
- **Informed Decisions**: Clear understanding of quality vs. risk tradeoffs
- **Improved Communication**: Risk language bridges technical and business teams
- **Adaptive**: Strategy adjusts as risks change during development
- **Measurable**: Risk reduction can be tracked and reported

### Challenges
- **Subjective Assessment**: Risk evaluation can be influenced by bias
- **Requires Domain Knowledge**: Accurate risk assessment needs expertise
- **Initial Overhead**: Risk analysis adds upfront time investment
- **Incomplete Coverage**: Low-risk areas may receive minimal testing
- **False Confidence**: Focus on known risks may miss unknown issues
- **Documentation Burden**: Requires maintaining risk registers and assessments
- **Stakeholder Disagreement**: Different perspectives on risk priorities

### Job Seeker Application Examples

#### Example 1: Risk Register for Job Application Feature
```markdown
**Feature**: Job Application Submission System

| Risk ID | Description | Likelihood | Impact | Risk Level | Mitigation Strategy | Test Priority |
|---------|-------------|------------|--------|------------|---------------------|---------------|
| R-001 | Application data loss during submission | 2 | 5 | High | Transaction management, retry logic, data validation | Exhaustive |
| R-002 | Duplicate application submission | 3 | 3 | Medium | Idempotency checks, UI disable-on-submit | Extensive |
| R-003 | Resume file upload fails for large files | 4 | 3 | High | File size validation, chunked upload, error handling | Extensive |
| R-004 | Email notification not sent to applicant | 3 | 4 | High | Queue-based notification, retry mechanism, monitoring | Extensive |
| R-005 | Application status not updated in real-time | 2 | 2 | Low | Polling fallback, WebSocket error handling | Moderate |
| R-006 | Privacy: applicant data visible to wrong recruiter | 1 | 5 | Medium | RBAC, data isolation tests, access audit logging | Extensive |
| R-007 | SQL injection in application notes field | 2 | 5 | High | Parameterized queries, input sanitization, security testing | Exhaustive |
| R-008 | Application form slow for users with poor connection | 3 | 2 | Medium | Progressive enhancement, offline capability, performance testing | Moderate |
| R-009 | Browser compatibility issues (IE11) | 2 | 2 | Low | Graceful degradation, limited browser support | Minimal |
| R-010 | Apply button styling inconsistent | 4 | 1 | Low | Visual regression testing | Minimal |

**Testing Allocation**:
- Critical risks (R-001, R-007): 40% of testing effort
- High risks (R-003, R-004): 35% of testing effort
- Medium risks (R-002, R-006, R-008): 20% of testing effort
- Low risks (R-005, R-009, R-010): 5% of testing effort
```

#### Example 2: Risk-Based Test Planning
```markdown
**Scenario**: Sprint with limited QE capacity (2 testers, 5 days)

**Risk Assessment Results**:
1. Payment processing integration (New): CRITICAL
2. Job search algorithm change (Modified): HIGH
3. Profile picture upload (New): MEDIUM
4. UI theme color update (Modified): LOW

**Test Plan Based on Risk**:

**Day 1-2: Payment Processing (Critical)**
- Test environment: Staging with sandbox payment gateway
- Test types:
  - Functional: All payment flows (success, failure, cancellation)
  - Security: PCI compliance checks, data encryption
  - Integration: Payment gateway communication, webhook handling
  - Error handling: Network failures, timeout scenarios
  - Data integrity: Transaction records, audit logs
- Coverage target: 100% of payment flows
- Exit criteria: Zero critical/high defects

**Day 3: Job Search Algorithm (High)**
- Test environment: Staging with production-like data
- Test types:
  - Functional: Search relevance, filtering, sorting
  - Performance: Response times for complex queries
  - Edge cases: No results, too many results, special characters
- Coverage target: 90% of search scenarios
- Exit criteria: No critical defects, <2 high defects

**Day 4: Profile Picture Upload (Medium)**
- Test environment: Staging
- Test types:
  - Functional: Happy path upload
  - Compatibility: Image formats (JPG, PNG), file sizes
  - Error handling: Invalid format, too large files
- Coverage target: 70% of scenarios
- Exit criteria: Happy path works, errors handled gracefully

**Day 5: UI Theme Update (Low) + Regression**
- Test types:
  - Visual: Spot-check theme consistency
  - Regression: Automated test suite for critical paths
- Coverage: Automated regression + manual smoke test

**Residual Risk Acceptance**:
- Profile picture: Edge cases (HEIC format, corrupted files) not tested → documented and accepted
- UI theme: Accessibility compliance checks deferred to next sprint
```

#### Example 3: Dynamic Risk Re-Assessment
```markdown
**Initial Risk Assessment (Sprint Start)**:
- Feature A (User notifications): Medium risk → Moderate testing
- Feature B (Search UI update): Low risk → Minimal testing

**Week 2: Production Incident**
- Incident: Notification system failed, 10,000 users missed critical alerts
- Impact: Customer complaints, support tickets spike
- Root cause: Message queue overload

**Re-Assessed Risks**:
- Feature A (User notifications): NOW HIGH RISK
  - Likelihood increased: 2 → 4 (history of issues)
  - Impact increased: 3 → 4 (demonstrated business impact)
  - New risk level: High (was Medium)

**Adjusted Test Strategy**:
- Increase notification testing effort by 50%
- Add specific tests:
  - Queue capacity and backpressure handling
  - Notification delivery monitoring and alerting
  - Graceful degradation when queue unavailable
  - Load testing with peak message volumes
- Add acceptance criteria: Must handle 10x normal notification volume

**Outcome**: Adaptive testing prevents repeat incident
```

#### Example 4: Risk-Based Exploratory Testing Charter
```markdown
**Risk**: Job seekers unable to apply to jobs due to complex application form

**Risk Factors**:
- New feature with limited user testing
- Complex multi-step form with file uploads
- Mobile responsiveness concerns
- Integration with applicant tracking system (ATS)

**Exploratory Testing Charter**:

**Mission**: Discover usability and functional issues in job application flow

**Target Area**: Job application form (desktop and mobile)

**Risk Focus Areas**:
1. Form validation and error handling (High Risk)
2. File upload for resume/cover letter (High Risk)
3. Mobile usability (Medium Risk)
4. Performance with slow connections (Medium Risk)

**Test Ideas**:
- Fill form with invalid data in various combinations
- Upload files of different types and sizes
- Interrupt upload process (network disconnect, browser close)
- Submit form multiple times rapidly
- Navigate away and return to form
- Test on different mobile devices and screen sizes
- Use slow 3G connection simulation
- Copy/paste formatted text into text areas
- Test browser back/forward buttons
- Test with screen reader for accessibility

**Time Box**: 2 hours

**Deliverable**: Bug reports, usability observations, risk assessment update

**Session Notes**:
- Found: Resume upload fails silently on mobile Safari
- Found: Form resets when clicking "back" button (data loss)
- Observation: 12-field form feels overwhelming on mobile
- Suggestion: Add "Save as Draft" functionality
```

## 5. Exploratory Testing

### Definition
Exploratory Testing is an approach where test design and test execution happen simultaneously. Testers actively explore the application while learning about it, designing tests based on their findings, and executing those tests in a continuous discovery process. It emphasizes tester creativity, critical thinking, and adaptability.

**ISTQB Definition**: "An approach to testing whereby the testers dynamically design and execute tests based on their knowledge, exploration of the test item and the results of previous tests."

### Core Principles
- **Simultaneous Learning and Testing**: Learn about the system while testing it
- **Tester Freedom**: Leverage tester creativity and intuition
- **Adaptive Test Design**: Adjust testing based on what's discovered
- **Contextual**: Testing decisions based on context and risk
- **Critical Thinking**: Question assumptions and think like a user
- **Note-Taking**: Document findings, patterns, and areas for investigation
- **Time-Boxed Sessions**: Focused exploration with clear missions
- **Complementary**: Works alongside scripted testing, not replacing it

### Session-Based Test Management (SBTM)
```markdown
**Charter**: A clear mission for the testing session
- What to test: Feature, area, or risk to explore
- How to test: Approach, techniques, or tools to use
- Why to test: Goal or risk being addressed

**Time Box**: Fixed duration (typically 60-120 minutes)

**Session Report**:
- Charter and mission
- What was tested
- Bugs found
- Issues/questions raised
- Test coverage assessment
- Time spent on charter vs. opportunity vs. setup
- Session notes and observations
```

### When to Use
- **New features** without detailed requirements or test cases
- **Complex systems** where all scenarios can't be pre-defined
- **Usability evaluation** requiring human judgment
- **Supplement to automation** for areas difficult to script
- **Time-constrained testing** where scripted tests would take too long
- **After significant code changes** to find unexpected side effects
- **Beta testing** with real users exploring the application
- **When creativity is needed** to find unusual defect patterns

### Benefits
- **Defect Discovery**: Finds issues missed by scripted tests
- **Rapid Feedback**: Start testing immediately without extensive preparation
- **Adaptability**: Respond to system behavior and new information
- **Tester Engagement**: Leverages tester skills, knowledge, and creativity
- **Context-Sensitive**: Tests adjust to real-world usage patterns
- **Learning**: Builds deep understanding of system behavior
- **Cost-Effective**: Minimal upfront investment in test case documentation
- **Risk Coverage**: Can quickly focus on newly discovered risk areas

### Challenges
- **Non-Repeatable**: Difficult to reproduce exact test steps
- **Depends on Tester Skill**: Results vary based on tester experience
- **Limited Documentation**: Less detailed test artifacts
- **Measurement Difficulty**: Hard to quantify coverage and progress
- **Perceived Lack of Structure**: May seem ad-hoc to stakeholders
- **Training Required**: Effective exploratory testing requires skill development
- **Time Management**: Easy to lose focus without discipline
- **Reporting**: Requires clear session notes and findings documentation

### Job Seeker Application Examples

#### Example 1: Exploratory Testing Charter - Resume Upload
```markdown
**Session Charter Template**:

**Charter**: Explore resume upload functionality to discover usability and data handling issues

**Tester**: Alex Chen
**Date**: 2025-10-15
**Time Box**: 90 minutes
**Build**: v2.5.0-staging

**Areas to Explore**:
1. File format compatibility and edge cases
2. Error handling and user feedback
3. Resume parsing accuracy
4. Mobile vs. desktop experience

**Testing Notes**:

**[0-30 min] File Format Testing**:
- ✓ PDF upload works (test-resume.pdf, 1.2MB)
- ✓ DOCX upload works (resume.docx, 850KB)
- ✓ DOC (legacy) upload works (old-resume.doc, 420KB)
- ❌ BUG-001: PAGES format (Mac) shows "Success" but file not parsed
  - Steps: Upload resume.pages → Success message → Profile shows "No resume"
  - Expected: Either reject with clear error OR parse successfully
- ❌ BUG-002: 15MB PDF accepted but upload freezes at 99%
  - No timeout error message after 5 minutes
  - Browser console shows: "Network error: 413 Payload Too Large"
  - Expected: Reject large files with clear message before upload starts
- ✓ TXT format properly rejected with message "Please upload PDF or Word document"

**[30-60 min] Parsing Accuracy**:
- ✓ Standard single-column resume parsed correctly
- ⚠️ OBSERVATION: Two-column resume layout parsed poorly
  - Skills from left column mixed with work history from right column
  - Not a blocker but degrades user experience
- ❌ BUG-003: Resume with special characters in name (José García)
  - Name parsed as "Jos� Garc�a" (character encoding issue)
- ✓ Contact information (email, phone) extracted correctly
- ❌ BUG-004: LinkedIn URL in resume not clickable in profile preview
  - Shows as plain text instead of hyperlink

**[60-90 min] Mobile Experience**:
- ✓ Upload button accessible on mobile (iOS Safari, Android Chrome)
- ❌ BUG-005: On mobile, success message appears behind keyboard
  - User might not see confirmation
  - Suggestion: Dismiss keyboard after file selection
- ⚠️ QUESTION: Should mobile app allow camera photo of paper resume?
  - Current functionality doesn't support this
  - Potential enhancement for less tech-savvy users
- ✓ Uploaded resume viewable on mobile

**[Opportunity Testing - 15 min]**:
- Tested rapid successive uploads (5 files in 10 seconds)
  - ✓ System handled gracefully, only last upload saved (expected)
- Tested interrupting upload (closing browser tab mid-upload)
  - ⚠️ OBSERVATION: Partial file left in system (visible in admin panel)
  - Cleanup job should remove orphaned files

**Bugs Found**: 5 bugs, 3 observations/questions
**Risk Assessment**: File handling more fragile than expected - recommend additional testing
**Follow-Up**: Need test cases for character encoding, large files, and mobile UX
**Coverage**: Estimated 70% of upload scenarios explored
**Time Breakdown**: 75% charter, 15% opportunity, 10% setup
```

- ⚠️ Can open application in 3 browser tabs, leading to confusing state
```

#### Example 3: Heuristic-Based Exploratory Testing
```markdown
**Testing Heuristics for Job Application Form**

**SFDIPOT (San Francisco Depot) Heuristic**:

**Structure**:
- Test with minimum required fields only
- Test with all optional fields filled
- Test navigation between form sections
- Finding: ❌ "Next" button disabled state unclear (looks enabled but doesn't work)

**Function**:
- Test successful submission
- Test save as draft functionality
- Test form validation on submit
- Finding: ✓ Validation working correctly

**Data**:
- Too much: 5000-character cover letter
- Too little: Empty required fields
- Invalid: Email as "notanemail", phone as "abc123"
- Special characters: Names with apostrophes, hyphens, accent marks
- Finding: ❌ 5000-char cover letter causes database error (limit 2000 chars)
- Finding: ⚠️ No character counter on cover letter field

**Interface**:
- Test tab key navigation order
- Test copy/paste formatted text
- Test browser autofill
- Finding: ✓ Tab order logical
- Finding: ❌ Pasted text keeps original formatting (breaks design)

**Platform**:
- Test Chrome, Firefox, Safari
- Test mobile browsers (iOS Safari, Chrome Android)
- Test tablet (iPad)
- Finding: ⚠️ Date picker on mobile Safari defaults to wrong format

**Operations**:
- Test during peak hours
- Test with slow connection (3G simulation)
- Test with ad-blockers enabled
- Finding: ✓ Performance acceptable on 3G
- Finding: ❌ Ad-blocker blocks analytics, but also breaks "Apply" button

**Time**:
- Fill form slowly (10 minutes)
- Fill form rapidly (30 seconds)
- Leave form open for 30 minutes, then submit
- Finding: ⚠️ Session timeout loses form data (no draft auto-save)

**Goldilocks Heuristic** (Too big, too small, just right):
- File upload: 0 bytes, 1 byte, 5KB, 5MB, 50MB, 500MB
- Text fields: 0 chars, 1 char, max-1, max, max+1, 10x max
- Finding: ❌ No client-side validation for file size; upload fails on server
```

#### Example 4: Exploratory Testing for Mobile App
```markdown
**Mobile-Specific Exploratory Session**

**Charter**: Explore Job Seeker mobile app on iOS for usability and functional issues
**Environment**: iPhone 13 Pro, iOS 16.4, App version 3.2.0
**Time Box**: 120 minutes

**Test Ideas - Mobile Context**:
1. Interruptions (calls, notifications, app switching)
2. Gestures (swipe, pinch, long-press)
3. Orientation changes (portrait ↔ landscape)
4. Connectivity changes (WiFi → 4G → Airplane mode)
5. Battery saver mode impacts
6. Different screen sizes (iPhone SE vs. Pro Max)
7. Accessibility features (VoiceOver, Dynamic Type)

**Session Notes**:

**[0-30 min] Connectivity Testing**:
- Started job search on WiFi
- Switched to Airplane mode mid-search
- ✓ App showed offline message
- ❌ BUG: Cached search results not available offline
  - Competitor apps show last-viewed jobs offline
  - Recommendation: Implement offline caching
- Switched back to WiFi
- ⚠️ App didn't auto-retry search, required manual refresh

**[30-60 min] Interruption Testing**:
- Started filling application form (5 fields completed)
- Received phone call mid-form

## 6. Test-Driven Development (TDD)

### Definition
Test-Driven Development is a software development approach where tests are written before the production code. Following a short, iterative cycle (Red-Green-Refactor), developers write a failing test, implement minimal code to make it pass, then refactor while keeping tests green. This approach drives design and ensures comprehensive test coverage.

**Core Cycle**: Red (write failing test) → Green (make it pass) → Refactor (improve code)

### Core Principles
- **Test First**: Write tests before implementation code
- **Incremental Development**: Small steps, one test at a time
- **Fail First**: Every test must fail before passing (validates test works)
- **Minimal Code**: Write only enough code to pass the current test
- **Refactor Constantly**: Improve design continuously while tests provide safety
- **Fast Feedback**: Run tests frequently (seconds, not minutes)
- **Design Driver**: Tests drive API design and implementation structure
- **Living Documentation**: Tests document expected behavior

### The TDD Cycle
```markdown
1. **RED**: Write a failing test
   - Decide on next small piece of functionality
   - Write a test that specifies that functionality
   - Run test to verify it fails (if it passes, the test is wrong or unnecessary)

2. **GREEN**: Make the test pass
   - Write minimal code to make the test pass
   - Don't worry about perfect code yet
   - Avoid adding functionality beyond what the test requires
   - Run test to verify it passes

3. **REFACTOR**: Improve the code
   - Clean up code while keeping tests green
   - Remove duplication
   - Improve names, structure, and design
   - Run tests continuously to ensure nothing breaks

4. **REPEAT**: Next test
   - Pick next small piece of functionality
   - Repeat the cycle
```

### When to Use
- **New feature development** where requirements are clear
- **Bug fixing** by first writing a test that reproduces the bug
- **API design** where tests help define interface contracts
- **Refactoring** to ensure behavior preservation
- **Learning new technologies** to understand through testing
- **Complex algorithms** requiring step-by-step validation
- **Teams valuing clean code** and design quality

### Benefits
- **High Test Coverage**: Tests written for all production code
- **Better Design**: Tests drive toward loosely-coupled, testable code
- **Confidence in Changes**: Comprehensive tests enable safe refactoring
- **Regression Prevention**: New code less likely to break existing functionality
- **Living Documentation**: Tests demonstrate how code should be used
- **Reduced Debugging**: Failing tests pinpoint issues immediately
- **Simplified Debugging**: Small steps mean issues are isolated
- **Focus**: One small task at a time reduces overwhelm

### Challenges
- **Learning Curve**: TDD is a skill that takes practice to master
- **Initial Slowdown**: Can feel slower initially (speeds up over time)
- **Discipline Required**: Easy to skip tests when under pressure
- **Testing UI**: GUI testing in TDD can be challenging
- **Legacy Code**: Difficult to apply to existing untested code
- **Over-Testing**: Risk of testing implementation details instead of behavior
- **Team Buy-In**: Requires team commitment and cultural shift
- **Test Maintenance**: Large test suites require ongoing maintenance

### Job Seeker Application Examples

#### Example 1: TDD for Job Search Filter Logic
```javascript
// TEST FIRST (RED): Write failing test
describe('JobSearchFilter', () => {
  it('should filter jobs by minimum salary', () => {
    // Arrange
    const jobs = [
      { title: 'Engineer', salary: 100000 },
      { title: 'Manager', salary: 120000 },
      { title: 'Intern', salary: 60000 }
    ];
    const filter = new JobSearchFilter();

    // Act
    const result = filter.byMinSalary(jobs, 100000);

    // Assert
    expect(result).toHaveLength(2);
    expect(result[0].title).toBe('Engineer');
    expect(result[1].title).toBe('Manager');
  });
});

// Run test: FAILS (JobSearchFilter doesn't exist yet)

// IMPLEMENTATION (GREEN): Minimal code to pass
class JobSearchFilter {
  byMinSalary(jobs, minSalary) {
    return jobs.filter(job => job.salary >= minSalary);
  }
}

// Run test: PASSES

// REFACTOR: Improve code (if needed)
class JobSearchFilter {
  byMinSalary(jobs, minSalary) {
    this._validateInputs(jobs, minSalary);
    return jobs.filter(job => job.salary >= minSalary);
  }

  _validateInputs(jobs, minSalary) {
    if (!Array.isArray(jobs)) {
      throw new TypeError('Jobs must be an array');
    }
    if (typeof minSalary !== 'number' || minSalary < 0) {
      throw new TypeError('Min salary must be a positive number');
    }
  }
}

// Run tests: STILL PASS (need to add tests for validation)

// NEXT TEST (RED): Test validation
it('should throw error for invalid min salary', () => {
  const filter = new JobSearchFilter();
  expect(() => filter.byMinSalary([], -1000)).toThrow(TypeError);
});

// Test fails because validation not implemented
// Implement validation (GREEN)
// Test passes
// Refactor if needed
// Repeat...
```

#### Example 2: TDD for Application Submission
```javascript
// TDD Session: Building ApplicationService

// Test 1 (RED): Submit application successfully
describe('ApplicationService', () => {
  it('should submit application and return confirmation', async () => {
    const service = new ApplicationService();
    const applicationData = {
      jobId: '123',
      userId: '456',
      resume: 'resume.pdf',
      coverLetter: 'I am perfect for this job...'
    };

    const result = await service.submit(applicationData);

    expect(result.success).toBe(true);
    expect(result.applicationId).toBeDefined();
    expect(result.status).toBe('submitted');
  });
});

// IMPLEMENTATION (GREEN)
class ApplicationService {
  async submit(data) {
    const applicationId = this._generateId();
    return {
      success: true,
      applicationId,
      status: 'submitted'
    };
  }

  _generateId() {
    return Math.random().toString(36).substr(2, 9);
  }
}

// Test 2 (RED): Validate required fields
it('should throw error if required fields missing', async () => {
  const service = new ApplicationService();
  const incompleteData = { jobId: '123' }; // Missing userId, resume

  await expect(service.submit(incompleteData)).rejects.toThrow('Missing required fields');
});

// IMPLEMENTATION (GREEN)
class ApplicationService {
  async submit(data) {
    this._validateRequiredFields(data);
    const applicationId = this._generateId();
    return {
      success: true,
      applicationId,
      status: 'submitted'
    };
  }

  _validateRequiredFields(data) {
    const required = ['jobId', 'userId', 'resume'];
    const missing = required.filter(field => !data[field]);
    if (missing.length > 0) {
      throw new Error('Missing required fields');
    }
  }

  _generateId() {
    return Math.random().toString(36).substr(2, 9);
  }
}

// Test 3 (RED): Prevent duplicate submissions
it('should prevent duplicate application submission', async () => {
  const service = new ApplicationService();
  const applicationData = {
    jobId: '123',
    userId: '456',
    resume: 'resume.pdf'
  };

  await service.submit(applicationData);
  await expect(service.submit(applicationData)).rejects.toThrow('Duplicate application');
});

// IMPLEMENTATION (GREEN): Add duplicate detection
class ApplicationService {
  constructor() {
    this.submittedApplications = new Set();
  }

  async submit(data) {
    this._validateRequiredFields(data);
    this._checkDuplicate(data);

    const applicationId = this._generateId();
    this.submittedApplications.add(`${data.jobId}-${data.userId}`);

    return {
      success: true,
      applicationId,
      status: 'submitted'
    };
  }

  _checkDuplicate(data) {
    const key = `${data.jobId}-${data.userId}`;
    if (this.submittedApplications.has(key)) {
      throw new Error('Duplicate application');
    }
  }

  // ... other methods
}

// REFACTOR: Extract application key logic
class ApplicationService {
  constructor() {
    this.submittedApplications = new Set();
  }

  async submit(data) {
    this._validateRequiredFields(data);
    this._checkDuplicate(data);

    const applicationId = this._generateId();
    const applicationKey = this._createApplicationKey(data);
    this.submittedApplications.add(applicationKey);

    return {
      success: true,
      applicationId,
      status: 'submitted'
    };
  }

  _createApplicationKey(data) {
    return `${data.jobId}-${data.userId}`;
  }

  _checkDuplicate(data) {
    if (this.submittedApplications.has(this._createApplicationKey(data))) {
      throw new Error('Duplicate application');
    }
  }

  _validateRequiredFields(data) {
    const required = ['jobId', 'userId', 'resume'];
    const missing = required.filter(field => !data[field]);
    if (missing.length > 0) {
      throw new Error(`Missing required fields: ${missing.join(', ')}`);
    }
  }

  _generateId() {
    return Math.random().toString(36).substr(2, 9);
  }
}

// Continue with more tests:
// - Test 4: Persist application to database
// - Test 5: Send confirmation email
// - Test 6: Handle database errors gracefully
// - Test 7: Validate resume file format
// ... etc.
```

#### Example 3: TDD for Bug Fix
```javascript
// BUG REPORT: Job search returns incorrect results when using date filter

// Step 1 (RED): Write test that reproduces the bug
describe('JobSearch - Date Filter Bug', () => {
  it('should only return jobs posted within the last 7 days', () => {
    const today = new Date('2025-10-04');
    const jobs = [
      { id: 1, title: 'Engineer', postedDate: new Date('2025-10-03') }, // 1 day ago ✓
      { id: 2, title: 'Manager', postedDate: new Date('2025-09-28') },  // 6 days ago ✓
      { id: 3, title: 'Designer', postedDate: new Date('2025-09-20') }, // 14 days ago ✗
      { id: 4, title: 'Analyst', postedDate: new Date('2025-10-04') }   // Today ✓
    ];

    const search = new JobSearch();
    const result = search.filterByDaysAgo(jobs, 7, today);

    expect(result).toHaveLength(3);
    expect(result.map(j => j.id)).toEqual([1, 2, 4]);
  });
});

// Run test: FAILS (reproduces the bug - currently returns 4 jobs instead of 3)

// Step 2 (GREEN): Fix the bug
class JobSearch {
  filterByDaysAgo(jobs, days, referenceDate = new Date()) {
    const cutoffDate = new Date(referenceDate);
    cutoffDate.setDate(cutoffDate.getDate() - days);

    // BUG WAS HERE: Used > instead of >=
    // return jobs.filter(job => job.postedDate > cutoffDate);

    // FIXED:
    return jobs.filter(job => job.postedDate >= cutoffDate);
  }
}

// Run test: PASSES (bug fixed)

// Step 3 (REFACTOR): Add edge case tests
it('should handle jobs posted exactly 7 days ago', () => {
  const today = new Date('2025-10-04T12:00:00');
  const exactly7DaysAgo = new Date('2025-09-27T12:00:00');

  const jobs = [
    { id: 1, title: 'Engineer', postedDate: exactly7DaysAgo }
  ];

  const search = new JobSearch();
  const result = search.filterByDaysAgo(jobs, 7, today);

  expect(result).toHaveLength(1); // Should include job posted exactly 7 days ago
});

it('should handle timezone differences correctly', () => {
  const today = new Date('2025-10-04T23:59:59Z'); // UTC
  const job = { id: 1, title: 'Engineer', postedDate: new Date('2025-09-27T00:00:01Z') };

  const search = new JobSearch();
  const result = search.filterByDaysAgo([job], 7, today);

  expect(result).toHaveLength(1);
});

// All tests pass - bug fixed with confidence!
```

#### Example 4: TDD Kata - Job Matching Score
```javascript
// Build a job matching algorithm using TDD

// Test 1: Basic skill match
it('should return 100% match for exact skill match', () => {
  const userSkills = ['JavaScript', 'React', 'Node.js'];
  const jobSkills = ['JavaScript', 'React', 'Node.js'];

// Implement minimal code
class JobMatcher {
  calculateMatch(userSkills, jobSkills) {
    return 100; // Hardcoded to pass first test
  }
}

// Test 2: Partial skill match
it('should return 50% match for half skills matched', () => {
  const userSkills = ['JavaScript', 'React'];
  const jobSkills = ['JavaScript', 'React', 'Node.js', 'TypeScript'];

    }
    if (jobSkills.length === 0) {
      throw new Error('Job must have at least one required skill');
    }
  }
}

// Continue adding tests for:
// - Weighted skills (senior skills worth more)
// - Years of experience factor
// - Must-have vs. nice-to-have skills
// - Synonym matching (JS = JavaScript)
// etc.
```

## 7. Behavior-Driven Development (BDD)

### Definition
Behavior-Driven Development is an extension of TDD that focuses on the behavioral specification of software using examples in natural language. BDD encourages collaboration between developers, QA, and non-technical stakeholders through structured conversations about features and their expected behavior. Tests are written in a ubiquitous language that all stakeholders can understand.

**Core Concept**: Specification by Example using Given-When-Then format

### Core Principles
- **Shared Understanding**: Common language between technical and business stakeholders
- **Behavior Over Implementation**: Focus on what the system should do, not how
- **Outside-In Development**: Start with user-facing behavior
- **Specification by Example**: Use concrete examples to define requirements
- **Living Documentation**: Executable specifications that stay up-to-date
- **Collaboration**: Three Amigos (Business, Development, QA) work together
- **Ubiquitous Language**: Use domain terminology consistently

### The Three Amigos
```markdown
**Three Amigos Meeting**: Collaborative session before development

**Participants**:
1. **Business (Product Owner)**: Defines feature value and requirements
2. **Development**: Provides technical feasibility and implementation insights
3. **QA/Testing**: Identifies edge cases, scenarios, and quality criteria

**Goal**: Create shared understanding and acceptance criteria

**Output**:
- Feature description
- Scenarios (Given-When-Then)
- Edge cases and assumptions
- Acceptance criteria
```

### Given-When-Then Format
```gherkin
Given [initial context/precondition]
When [event/action occurs]
Then [expected outcome/behavior]

Example:
Given I am a logged-in job seeker
  And I have a complete profile
When I click "Apply" on a software engineer job posting
Then I should see an application confirmation message
  And the job should appear in my "Applied Jobs" list
  And the recruiter should receive my application
```

### When to Use
- **Complex business domains** requiring stakeholder collaboration
- **Teams with non-technical stakeholders** involved in requirements
- **Projects needing living documentation** of business rules
- **User story refinement** to clarify acceptance criteria
- **Integration and E2E testing** focused on user behavior
- **Domain-Driven Design** projects with rich domain models
- **Regulatory environments** requiring traceable requirements

### Benefits
- **Better Communication**: Shared language bridges technical and business teams
- **Clear Requirements**: Examples eliminate ambiguity
- **Living Documentation**: Specs that are always accurate and executable
- **Reduced Rework**: Misunderstandings caught before coding
- **Focused Development**: Clear acceptance criteria guide implementation
- **Regression Testing**: BDD scenarios become automated tests
- **Stakeholder Confidence**: Non-technical stakeholders can review tests
- **Domain Knowledge**: Tests capture business rules explicitly

### Challenges
- **Learning Curve**: New vocabulary and mindset for teams
- **Time Investment**: Three Amigos meetings add upfront time
- **Scenario Maintenance**: Large scenario suites require maintenance
- **Over-Specification**: Risk of too many scenarios or too much detail
- **Tooling Complexity**: BDD frameworks add another layer
- **Not Unit Testing**: BDD works at integration/system level, not unit tests
- **Writing Skills**: Good scenarios require practice and skill
- **False Sense of Coverage**: Green scenarios don't guarantee quality

### Job Seeker Application Examples

#### Example 1: Feature File - Job Search
```gherkin
# features/job-search.feature

Feature: Job Search
  As a job seeker
  I want to search for jobs using filters
  So that I can find relevant opportunities

  Background:
    Given the following jobs exist in the system:
      | Title              | Company    | Location      | Salary  | Posted Date |
      | Senior Engineer    | TechCorp   | San Francisco | 150000  | 2025-10-01  |
      | Junior Developer   | StartupX   | Remote        | 80000   | 2025-10-03  |
      | Engineering Manager| BigCompany | New York      | 180000  | 2025-09-20  |
      | QA Engineer        | TechCorp   | San Francisco | 120000  | 2025-10-02  |

  Scenario: Search jobs by location
    Given I am on the job search page
    When I enter "San Francisco" in the location filter
      And I click the "Search" button
    Then I should see 2 job results
      And I should see "Senior Engineer"
      And I should see "QA Engineer"
      And I should not see "Junior Developer"

  Scenario: Search jobs by salary range
    Given I am on the job search page
    When I set minimum salary to "100000"
      And I set maximum salary to "160000"
      And I click the "Search" button
    Then I should see 2 job results
      And all displayed jobs should have salaries between 100000 and 160000

  Scenario: Search jobs posted in last 7 days
    Given I am on the job search page
      And today is "2025-10-04"
    When I select "Last 7 days" from the date filter
      And I click the "Search" button
    Then I should see 3 job results
      And I should not see "Engineering Manager"

  Scenario: Combine multiple filters
    Given I am on the job search page
    When I enter "San Francisco" in the location filter
      And I set minimum salary to "100000"
      And I select "Last 7 days" from the date filter
      And I click the "Search" button
    Then I should see 2 job results
      And all results should match all filter criteria

  Scenario: No results found
    Given I am on the job search page
    When I enter "Antarctica" in the location filter
      And I click the "Search" button
    Then I should see "No jobs found" message
      And I should see a suggestion to "Try broadening your search criteria"

  Scenario Outline: Search by job title keyword
    Given I am on the job search page
    When I search for "<keyword>"
    Then I should see <count> job results

    Examples:
      | keyword   | count |
      | Engineer  | 3     |
      | Manager   | 1     |
      | Developer | 1     |
      | Designer  | 0     |
```

#### Example 2: Step Definitions (JavaScript/Cucumber)
```javascript
// features/step_definitions/job-search.steps.js

const { Given, When, Then } = require('@cucumber/cucumber');
const { expect } = require('chai');
const JobSearchPage = require('../pages/JobSearchPage');
const JobDatabase = require('../support/JobDatabase');

let jobSearchPage;
let jobDatabase;
let searchResults;

Given('the following jobs exist in the system:', async (dataTable) => {
  jobDatabase = new JobDatabase();
  const jobs = dataTable.hashes(); // Convert table to array of objects
  await jobDatabase.seedJobs(jobs);
});

Given('I am on the job search page', async () => {
  jobSearchPage = new JobSearchPage();
  await jobSearchPage.navigate();
});

Given('today is {string}', (date) => {
  jobSearchPage.setCurrentDate(new Date(date));
});

When('I enter {string} in the location filter', async (location) => {
  await jobSearchPage.enterLocation(location);
});

When('I set minimum salary to {string}', async (minSalary) => {
  await jobSearchPage.setMinSalary(parseInt(minSalary));
});

When('I set maximum salary to {string}', async (maxSalary) => {
  await jobSearchPage.setMaxSalary(parseInt(maxSalary));
});

When('I select {string} from the date filter', async (dateRange) => {
  await jobSearchPage.selectDateRange(dateRange);
});

When('I click the {string} button', async (buttonText) => {
  await jobSearchPage.clickButton(buttonText);
  searchResults = await jobSearchPage.getSearchResults();
});

When('I search for {string}', async (keyword) => {
  await jobSearchPage.searchByKeyword(keyword);
  searchResults = await jobSearchPage.getSearchResults();
});

Then('I should see {int} job result(s)', (expectedCount) => {
  expect(searchResults.length).to.equal(expectedCount);
});

Then('I should see {string}', async (jobTitle) => {
  const titles = searchResults.map(job => job.title);
  expect(titles).to.include(jobTitle);
});

Then('I should not see {string}', (jobTitle) => {
  const titles = searchResults.map(job => job.title);
  expect(titles).to.not.include(jobTitle);
});

Then('all displayed jobs should have salaries between {int} and {int}',
  (minSalary, maxSalary) => {
    searchResults.forEach(job => {
      expect(job.salary).to.be.at.least(minSalary);
      expect(job.salary).to.be.at.most(maxSalary);
    });
});

Then('I should see {string} message', async (message) => {
  const displayedMessage = await jobSearchPage.getNoResultsMessage();
  expect(displayedMessage).to.include(message);
});

Then('I should see a suggestion to {string}', async (suggestion) => {
  const displayedSuggestion = await jobSearchPage.getSuggestionMessage();
  expect(displayedSuggestion).to.include(suggestion);
});
```

#### Example 3: BDD for API Testing
```gherkin
# features/application-api.feature

Feature: Job Application API
  As a job seeker
  I want to submit job applications via API
  So that I can apply to jobs programmatically

  Background:
    Given I am authenticated as user "john@example.com"
      And a job posting exists with ID "job-123"

  Scenario: Successfully submit a job application
    When I POST to "/api/applications" with:
      """
      {
        "jobId": "job-123",
        "coverLetter": "I am very interested in this position...",
        "resumeUrl": "https://storage.example.com/resumes/john-resume.pdf"
      }
      """
    Then the response status should be 201
      And the response should contain:
        | field         | value     |
        | success       | true      |
        | status        | submitted |
      And the response should have a field "applicationId"
      And an application record should exist in the database
      And the applicant should receive a confirmation email

  Scenario: Reject application with missing required fields
    When I POST to "/api/applications" with:
      """
      {
        "jobId": "job-123"
      }
      """
    Then the response status should be 400
      And the response should contain:
        """
        {
          "error": "Validation failed",
          "missingFields": ["resumeUrl"]
        }
        """

  Scenario: Prevent duplicate application submission
    Given I have already applied to job "job-123"
    When I POST to "/api/applications" with:
      """
      {
        "jobId": "job-123",
        "resumeUrl": "https://storage.example.com/resumes/john-resume.pdf"
      }
      """
    Then the response status should be 409
      And the response should contain:
        """
        {
          "error": "You have already applied to this job"
        }
        """

  Scenario: Application to non-existent job
    When I POST to "/api/applications" with:
      """
      {
        "jobId": "non-existent-job",
        "resumeUrl": "https://storage.example.com/resumes/john-resume.pdf"
      }
      """
    Then the response status should be 404
      And the response should contain an error "Job not found"

  Scenario: Unauthenticated application attempt
    Given I am not authenticated
    When I POST to "/api/applications" with valid data
    Then the response status should be 401
      And the response should contain an error "Authentication required"
```

#### Example 4: Three Amigos Session Output
```markdown
## Feature: AI-Powered Resume Recommendations

**Three Amigos Session**: 2025-10-01
**Participants**:
- Product Owner: Sarah (Business)
- Developer: Alex (Engineering)
- QA: Jordan (Quality)

### Feature Description
As a job seeker, I want AI-powered suggestions to improve my resume so that I can increase my chances of getting interviews.

### Discussion Notes

**Sarah (PO)**: "Users upload their resume and select a target job. The AI analyzes the resume and suggests improvements."

**Alex (Dev)**: "What kind of suggestions? Skills to add, formatting changes, content rewrites?"

**Sarah**: "All of the above. Focus on skills gap and keyword optimization for ATS systems."

**Jordan (QA)**: "What if the resume is in an unsupported format? What about privacy concerns with AI processing?"

**Alex**: "Good point. We'll need to handle various formats and ensure data isn't sent to third-party AI without consent."

### Scenarios Identified

**Scenario 1: Basic Resume Analysis (Happy Path)**
```gherkin
Given I am a logged-in job seeker
  And I have uploaded my resume in PDF format
When I select a target job posting for "Senior Software Engineer"
  And I click "Analyze Resume"
Then I should see an analysis report within 30 seconds
  And the report should include:
    | Missing Skills      | 3-5 specific skills from job posting |
    | Keyword Optimization| Suggested keywords for ATS          |
    | Format Suggestions  | Formatting improvements             |
    | Overall Match Score | Percentage match with job           |
```

**Scenario 2: Unsupported File Format**
```gherkin
Given I am a logged-in job seeker
When I attempt to upload a resume in .txt format
Then I should see an error message "Supported formats: PDF, DOCX"
  And the file should not be uploaded
  And I should be prompted to convert or re-upload
```

**Scenario 3: Privacy Consent**
```gherkin
Given I am about to analyze my resume for the first time
When I click "Analyze Resume"
Then I should see a privacy consent dialog
  And the dialog should explain that my resume will be processed by AI
  And I must consent before analysis proceeds
When I click "I Consent"
Then the analysis should proceed
  And my consent should be recorded in my profile
```

**Scenario 4: Analyzing Resume Without Target Job**
```gherkin
Given I have uploaded my resume
  And I have not selected a target job
When I click "Analyze Resume"
Then I should see a general resume quality report
  And the report should include:
    | Grammar Check  | Typos and grammatical errors       |
    | Format Quality | Overall formatting score           |
    | Completeness   | Missing sections (summary, skills) |
  But the report should not include job-specific match score
```

**Scenario 5: Long Processing Time**
```gherkin
Given the AI service is experiencing high load
  And analysis will take longer than 30 seconds
When I click "Analyze Resume"
Then I should see a loading indicator
  And I should see a message "Analysis in progress, this may take up to 2 minutes"
When the analysis completes
Then I should receive a notification
  And the report should be displayed
```

### Edge Cases & Questions

**Edge Case 1**: What if the job posting has no skills listed?
- **Decision**: Show general resume quality report, warn user that job-specific analysis requires detailed job posting

**Edge Case 2**: What if the resume is 20 pages long?
- **Decision**: Set limit of 5 pages, show error for longer resumes

**Edge Case 3**: What if AI service is down?
- **Decision**: Show error message, allow user to retry or be notified when service is restored

**Question**: Should users be able to save multiple analysis reports?
- **Decision**: Yes, save last 5 reports for comparison over time

**Question**: Can users accept/reject suggestions?
- **Decision**: Phase 2 feature - allow users to mark suggestions as helpful/not helpful for AI improvement

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Resume analysis completes within 30 seconds for standard resumes (< 5 pages)
2. Supports PDF and DOCX formats
3. Privacy consent obtained before first analysis
4. At least 3 actionable suggestions provided per analysis
5. Match score calculated using defined algorithm (documented separately)
6. Error handling for all failure scenarios
7. Analysis results saved and retrievable for 30 days

### Technical Considerations (Alex)
- Use OpenAI API for NLP analysis (requires API key management)
- Implement queue for analysis requests (handle concurrent users)
- Cache job posting analysis to avoid re-processing
- Store analysis results in database with user association

### Testing Considerations (Jordan)
- Test with 10+ diverse resume samples (formats, lengths, industries)
- Validate privacy consent flow and data handling
- Performance testing with concurrent analysis requests
- Security testing for file upload vulnerabilities
- Accessibility testing for analysis report display
```

## 8. Acceptance Test-Driven Development (ATDD)

### Definition
Acceptance Test-Driven Development is a collaborative practice where business stakeholders, developers, and testers define acceptance criteria in the form of tests before development begins. These acceptance tests serve as the definition of "done" for a feature and are typically automated. ATDD focuses on ensuring the team builds the right thing by collaborating on testable acceptance criteria.

**Core Principle**: Define acceptance criteria as executable tests before coding

### Core Principles
- **Collaboration First**: Business, dev, and QA collaborate on acceptance criteria
- **Test-First**: Write acceptance tests before implementation
- **Executable Specifications**: Acceptance criteria are automated tests
- **Definition of Done**: Feature is complete when acceptance tests pass
- **Customer Focus**: Tests reflect customer's perspective and value
- **Early Validation**: Uncover misunderstandings before coding
- **Fast Feedback**: Automated tests provide quick validation
- **Regression Prevention**: Acceptance tests become regression suite

### ATDD Workflow
```markdown
1. **Discuss**: Three Amigos discuss feature and examples
   - What should the feature do?
   - What are the edge cases?
   - What does success look like?

2. **Distill**: Convert examples into testable acceptance criteria
   - Write acceptance tests (often in Given-When-Then format)
   - Define test data and expected outcomes
   - Review and agree on criteria

3. **Develop**: Implement feature to pass acceptance tests
   - Write code to make tests pass
   - Use TDD at unit level alongside ATDD
   - Refactor as needed

4. **Demo**: Show working feature with passing acceptance tests
   - Demonstrate feature to stakeholders
   - Show green acceptance tests
   - Gather feedback

5. **Deploy**: Release feature with automated acceptance test suite
   - Acceptance tests become part of regression suite
   - Continuous validation in CI/CD pipeline
```

### ATDD vs. BDD vs. TDD
```markdown
**TDD (Test-Driven Development)**:
- Level: Unit tests
- Focus: Code design and correctness
- Written by: Developers
- Language: Programming language (JUnit, Jest, etc.)
- Example: Testing individual functions/methods

**BDD (Behavior-Driven Development)**:
- Level: System/integration tests
- Focus: System behavior from user perspective
- Written by: Collaboration (Three Amigos)
- Language: Natural language (Gherkin, Given-When-Then)
- Example: "Given I'm logged in, When I click Apply, Then..."

**ATDD (Acceptance Test-Driven Development)**:
- Level: Feature/acceptance tests
- Focus: Customer acceptance criteria
- Written by: Collaboration with customer/PO
- Language: Customer-facing test format (can be Gherkin or test framework)
- Example: Testing complete user stories meet acceptance criteria

**Relationship**:
- ATDD and BDD are very similar (often used interchangeably)
- BDD emphasizes behavior and ubiquitous language
- ATDD emphasizes acceptance criteria and customer collaboration
- TDD operates at lower (unit) level
- All three can be used together on same project
```

### When to Use
- **Agile teams** working from user stories
- **Projects with active stakeholder involvement**
- **Features with clear acceptance criteria**
- **Complex business logic** requiring stakeholder validation
- **Teams struggling with "definition of done"**
- **Regulatory environments** requiring traceable requirements
- **Customer-facing features** with specific UX requirements

### Benefits
- **Shared Understanding**: Entire team understands what to build
- **Reduced Rework**: Catch misunderstandings before coding
- **Clear Definition of Done**: No ambiguity about feature completion
- **Improved Quality**: Features meet actual customer needs
- **Testable Requirements**: Forces clarity in requirements
- **Living Documentation**: Tests document expected behavior
- **Regression Safety**: Acceptance tests prevent feature breakage
- **Stakeholder Confidence**: Stakeholders can see passing tests

### Challenges
- **Time Investment**: Upfront time for collaboration and test writing
- **Requires Collaboration**: Needs engaged business stakeholders
- **Test Maintenance**: Large acceptance test suites need upkeep
- **Slow Execution**: Acceptance tests typically slower than unit tests
- **Test Environment**: Requires stable test environment and data
- **Skills Gap**: Team needs training in ATDD practices
- **Over-Specification**: Risk of too many detailed tests
- **Tool Complexity**: May require additional frameworks and tools

### Job Seeker Application Examples

#### Example 1: ATDD for User Story - Profile Completion
```markdown
## User Story
**As a** job seeker
**I want** to see my profile completion percentage
**So that** I know what information I still need to add to maximize my job prospects

**Acceptance Criteria** (defined collaboratively):

### AC1: Profile completion percentage displayed
**Given** I am a logged-in job seeker
**When** I view my profile page
**Then** I should see my profile completion percentage prominently displayed
**And** the percentage should be accurate based on completed fields

### AC2: Calculation includes all profile sections
**Given** the following profile sections exist:
  - Personal Info (name, email, phone)
  - Work Experience
  - Education
  - Skills
  - Resume Upload
**When** I have completed 3 out of 5 sections
**Then** my profile completion should be 60%

### AC3: Visual indicator for incomplete sections
**Given** I have incomplete profile sections
**When** I view my profile page
**Then** I should see visual indicators (icons/badges) showing which sections are incomplete
**And** I should see the number of fields remaining in each section

### AC4: Clicking incomplete section navigates to that section
**Given** I see an incomplete section indicator
**When** I click on the "Work Experience" incomplete indicator
**Then** I should be taken directly to the Work Experience section
**And** empty required fields should be highlighted
```

**Automated Acceptance Tests**:

```javascript
// tests/acceptance/profile-completion.spec.js

describe('Profile Completion Feature', () => {

  describe('AC1: Profile completion percentage displayed', () => {
    it('should display profile completion percentage on profile page', async () => {
      // Arrange
      const user = await createUser({ email: 'test@example.com' });
      await completeProfileSections(user, ['personalInfo', 'skills']);

      // Act
      const profilePage = await loginAndNavigateToProfile(user);

      // Assert
      const completionPercentage = await profilePage.getCompletionPercentage();
      expect(completionPercentage).toBeDefined();
      expect(completionPercentage).toMatch(/\d+%/); // Format: "40%"
    });

    it('should display completion percentage prominently', async () => {
      const user = await createUser({ email: 'test@example.com' });
      const profilePage = await loginAndNavigateToProfile(user);

      const element = await profilePage.getCompletionElement();

#### Example 2: ATDD Workshop Session
```markdown
## ATDD Workshop: Resume Parsing Feature

**Date**: 2025-10-01
**Participants**: Product Owner (Lisa), Developer (Marco), QA (Aisha)

### Step 1: Discuss the Feature

**Lisa (PO)**: "When a user uploads their resume, we should automatically extract their information and pre-fill their profile to save time."

**Marco (Dev)**: "What information do we extract? Name, contact info, work history?"

**Lisa**: "Yes, and also education, skills, and certifications if available."

**Aisha (QA)**: "What happens if the parsing fails or returns incorrect data? Can users override it?"

**Lisa**: "Good question. Users should always be able to edit the extracted information. Let's make it a suggestion, not automatic save."

**Marco**: "What file formats do we support?"

**Lisa**: "PDF and Word documents to start. Those are most common."

### Step 2: Distill into Acceptance Tests

**Acceptance Test 1: Successfully parse standard resume**
```gherkin
Given I am a logged-in job seeker
  And I have a resume file "standard-resume.pdf" with:
    | Field          | Value                      |
    | Name           | John Doe                   |
    | Email          | john.doe@example.com       |
    | Phone          | (555) 123-4567             |
    | Work History   | Software Engineer at ABC   |
    | Education      | BS Computer Science, XYZ U |
    | Skills         | Java, Python, SQL          |
When I upload the resume
Then I should see a preview with extracted information
  And the name field should contain "John Doe"
  And the email field should contain "john.doe@example.com"
  And the work history should include "Software Engineer at ABC"
  And the skills should include "Java, Python, SQL"
  And the information should NOT be saved automatically
  And I should see a "Confirm & Save" button
```

**Acceptance Test 2: Handle parsing errors gracefully**
```gherkin
Given I am a logged-in job seeker
  And I have an image-based PDF resume (non-text)
When I upload the resume
Then I should see a message "We couldn't extract text from your resume"
  And I should see an option to "Enter information manually"
  And the resume file should still be attached to my profile
  And I should be able to retry with OCR processing (premium feature)
```

**Acceptance Test 3: User can edit extracted information**
```gherkin
Given I have uploaded a resume
  And the system extracted my name as "J. Doe"
When I edit the name field to "Jane Doe"
  And I click "Confirm & Save"
Then my profile name should be saved as "Jane Doe"
  And the original resume file should remain unchanged
```

**Acceptance Test 4: Support multiple file formats**
```gherkin
Given I am a logged-in job seeker
When I upload a resume in <format>
Then the system should successfully parse it
  And extract available information

Examples:
  | format |
  | .pdf   |
  | .docx  |
  | .doc   |
```

**Acceptance Test 5: Handle missing information**
```gherkin
Given I upload a resume with only name and email
  And the resume has no work history or education
When the parsing completes
Then I should see the extracted name and email
  And work history section should show "No work history found"
  And I should see a prompt to "Add your work experience manually"
  And the profile completion percentage should reflect missing sections
```

### Step 3: Define Test Data

**Test Resume Files** (to be created):
- `standard-resume.pdf`: Complete, well-formatted resume
- `minimal-resume.pdf`: Only name and contact info
- `complex-layout.pdf`: Two-column, creative design
- `image-resume.pdf`: Scanned document (OCR test)
- `resume.docx`: Microsoft Word format
- `resume-special-chars.pdf`: Name with accents, special characters

### Step 4: Identify Edge Cases

**Edge Case 1**: Resume with multiple email addresses
- **Decision**: Extract all, let user choose primary

**Edge Case 2**: 10-page resume with extensive work history
- **Decision**: Extract all, paginate in preview

**Edge Case 3**: Resume in language other than English
- **Decision**: Phase 1 - English only, show error for other languages

**Edge Case 4**: Resume with confidential information (SSN, etc.)
- **Decision**: Never display SSN-like patterns in preview, security scan before storage

### Step 5: Automation Plan (Aisha)

**Test Automation Strategy**:
1. **API-Level Tests** (60%):
   - Test parsing service with various resume files
   - Validate extracted data structure
   - Fast execution (~5 min for full suite)

2. **UI-Level Tests** (40%):
   - Test upload flow and preview display
   - Test edit and save functionality
   - Visual validation of extracted data
   - Execution time: ~15 min

**Tool Selection**:
- Parsing tests: Mocha + Chai (API testing)
- UI tests: Playwright (E2E)
- Test data: Stored in `/tests/fixtures/resumes/`

### Step 6: Definition of Done

**Feature is complete when**:
✅ All acceptance tests pass (automated)
✅ Supports PDF and DOCX formats
✅ Extracts name, email, phone, work history, education, skills
✅ Handles parsing errors with clear messages
✅ Users can edit extracted information
✅ No automatic save (preview + confirm flow)
✅ Code review completed
✅ Documentation updated
✅ Performance: Parsing completes within 5 seconds
✅ Security: No sensitive data exposed in logs/errors

### Step 7: Development Begins

**Marco starts development** with failing acceptance tests:
- Tests written first (currently failing/red)
- Implements parsing service
- Implements UI preview
- Iterates until all tests green
- Refactors and optimizes

**Daily stand-up check**: "How many acceptance tests are passing?"
```

#### Example 3: ATDD Test Pyramid for Job Seeker
```markdown
## ATDD Test Strategy for Job Seeker Application

### Level 1: Acceptance Tests (ATDD)
**Purpose**: Validate features meet customer acceptance criteria
**Count**: 50-100 scenarios
**Execution Time**: 30-60 minutes
**Run Frequency**: On PR merge, before release

**Examples**:
- User can search and apply to jobs
- User receives email notifications for application status
- Premium subscription enables advanced features
- Profile completion drives recommendation quality

**Tools**: Cucumber + Playwright

---

### Level 2: Integration Tests
**Purpose**: Validate component interactions
**Count**: 200-300 tests
**Execution Time**: 10-15 minutes
**Run Frequency**: On every commit

**Examples**:
- API endpoints return correct data
- Database operations persist data correctly
- External service integrations work (payment, email)
- Authentication and authorization flows

**Tools**: Jest + Supertest (API testing)

---

### Level 3: Unit Tests (TDD)
**Purpose**: Validate individual units of code
**Count**: 1000+ tests
**Execution Time**: 2-5 minutes
**Run Frequency**: On every save (watch mode)

**Examples**:
- Job search filter logic
- Salary calculation functions
- Date formatting utilities
- Validation rules

**Tools**: Jest

```

### Example: "Apply to Job" Feature Coverage

**Acceptance Test (ATDD)**:
```gherkin
Scenario: Job seeker applies to a job
  Given I am logged in as "john@example.com"
    And a job posting exists for "Senior Engineer"
  When I search for "Senior Engineer"
    And I click "Apply" on the first result
    And I submit my application
  Then I should see "Application submitted successfully"
    And the job should appear in my "Applied Jobs" list
    And the recruiter should receive my application
    And I should receive a confirmation email
```

**Integration Tests**:
- POST /api/applications returns 201 with application ID
- Application saved to database with correct associations
- Email service receives application confirmation request
- Notification service creates alert for recruiter

**Unit Tests** (TDD):
- ApplicationValidator.validate() rejects invalid data
- ApplicationService.checkDuplicate() detects duplicate applications
- EmailFormatter.formatApplicationConfirmation() creates correct template
- DateUtils.formatApplicationDate() formats dates correctly
```

## Summary: Choosing the Right Approach

### Decision Matrix

| Approach | Primary Focus | When to Use | Key Benefit | Main Challenge |
|----------|---------------|-------------|-------------|----------------|
| **Shift-Left** | Early testing | New projects, Agile/DevOps | Prevent defects early | Cultural change |
| **Shift-Right** | Production testing | Cloud-native, microservices | Real-world validation | Risk management |
| **Continuous Testing** | CI/CD integration | DevOps pipelines | Fast feedback | Test maintenance |
| **Risk-Based** | Prioritization | Limited resources, complex systems | Efficient coverage | Subjective assessment |
| **Exploratory** | Discovery | New features, complex systems | Find unexpected issues | Non-repeatable |
| **TDD** | Design & code quality | New development, bug fixes | High coverage, clean code | Learning curve |
| **BDD** | Behavior specification | Stakeholder collaboration | Shared understanding | Time investment |
| **ATDD** | Acceptance criteria | Agile teams, user stories | Clear definition of done | Requires collaboration |

### Combining Approaches

**Recommended Combination for Job Seeker Application**:

1. **Foundation**: TDD for all new code (unit tests first)
2. **Feature Definition**: ATDD/BDD for user stories (acceptance criteria as tests)
3. **Quality Assurance**: Continuous Testing in CI/CD pipeline
4. **Risk Management**: Risk-Based Testing for test prioritization
5. **Discovery**: Exploratory Testing for new features and edge cases
6. **Early Validation**: Shift-Left for requirements review and design
7. **Production Monitoring**: Shift-Right for feature flags and monitoring

**Example Workflow**:
```markdown
1. **Planning**: Three Amigos define acceptance criteria (ATDD/BDD)
2. **Design**: QE reviews for testability (Shift-Left)
3. **Development**: Developers use TDD for unit tests
4. **Automation**: Automate acceptance tests (ATDD)
5. **Prioritization**: Use risk-based approach for test execution order
6. **Exploration**: Exploratory testing session on completed feature
7. **Integration**: All tests run in CI/CD pipeline (Continuous Testing)
8. **Deployment**: Progressive rollout with monitoring (Shift-Right)
```
