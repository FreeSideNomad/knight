# Domain XIII: Emerging Topics in Quality Engineering

## Overview

This domain covers cutting-edge quality engineering practices that are becoming increasingly critical in modern software development, including AI/ML testing, accessibility compliance, IoT testing, blockchain validation, and performance engineering with observability.

## 1. AI/ML Testing

### Model Validation
- **Training Data Quality**: Validate completeness, accuracy, and representativeness
- **Model Performance Metrics**: Accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, AUC-ROC
- **Overfitting/Underfitting Detection**: Cross-validation, learning curves
- **Model Drift Monitoring**: Continuous validation of model performance in production

### Bias Detection
- **Fairness Metrics**: Demographic parity, equalized odds, disparate impact
- **Bias Testing**: Test across different demographic groups, edge cases
- **Explainability**: SHAP, LIME for model interpretability
- **Ethical AI**: Testing for unintended discriminatory outcomes

### Job Seeker Example: AI Matching Algorithm
- Validate job recommendation accuracy against user preferences
- Test for bias in candidate matching across demographics (gender, age, location)
- Monitor model drift as job market conditions change
- Ensure explainability of "why this job was recommended"

## 2. Accessibility Testing

### WCAG 2.2 AA Standards
- **Perceivable**: Text alternatives, captions, adaptable content, distinguishable elements
- **Operable**: Keyboard accessible, sufficient time, navigable, input modalities
- **Understandable**: Readable, predictable, input assistance
- **Robust**: Compatible with assistive technologies

### EU Accessibility Act 2025
- **Scope**: Websites, mobile apps, e-commerce, banking services
- **Requirements**: Compliance with EN 301 549 harmonized standard
- **Testing**: Screen readers, keyboard navigation, color contrast, focus management

### Testing Approach
- **Automated Testing**: axe-core, Lighthouse accessibility audits
- **Manual Testing**: Screen reader testing (NVDA, JAWS, VoiceOver)
- **User Testing**: Testing with users with disabilities
- **Continuous Monitoring**: Integration into CI/CD pipelines

### Tools
- **axe DevTools**: Browser extension for automated accessibility testing
- **Lighthouse**: Google's automated audit tool for accessibility, performance, SEO
- **WAVE**: Web accessibility evaluation tool
- **Pa11y**: Automated accessibility testing CLI tool

### Job Seeker Example: Accessibility Compliance
- Ensure job search filters are keyboard navigable
- Test screen reader compatibility for job descriptions
- Validate color contrast ratios for readability (AA level)
- Ensure form validation provides accessible error messages
- Test with assistive technologies for application submission flow

## 3. IoT Testing

### Basics
- **Device Testing**: Hardware, firmware, sensors, actuators
- **Connectivity Testing**: WiFi, Bluetooth, cellular, LoRaWAN
- **Protocol Testing**: MQTT, CoAP, HTTP/HTTPS, WebSockets
- **Security Testing**: Encryption, authentication, device management
- **Performance Testing**: Battery life, latency, throughput
- **Interoperability**: Testing across different devices and platforms

### Challenges
- Device diversity and fragmentation
- Real-world environment simulation
- Power consumption and battery constraints
- Network reliability and latency

## 4. Blockchain Testing

### Basics
- **Smart Contract Testing**: Logic validation, security vulnerabilities
- **Consensus Testing**: Validate blockchain consensus mechanisms
- **Transaction Testing**: Verify transaction accuracy, speed, finality
- **Security Testing**: Cryptographic validation, 51% attacks, private key management
- **Performance Testing**: Transaction throughput (TPS), block time, scalability

### Testing Approaches
- **Unit Testing**: Test individual smart contract functions
- **Integration Testing**: Test contract interactions
- **Testnet Deployment**: Deploy to test networks before mainnet
- **Security Audits**: Static analysis, penetration testing, formal verification

### Tools
- Truffle, Hardhat for smart contract testing
- Ganache for local blockchain simulation
- MythX, Slither for security analysis

## 5. Performance Engineering

### Observability
- **Three Pillars**: Metrics, logs, traces
- **Metrics**: System and application performance indicators (CPU, memory, response time)
- **Logs**: Structured logging for debugging and analysis
- **Distributed Tracing**: Request flow across microservices (OpenTelemetry, Jaeger)
- **Monitoring**: Real-time alerting and dashboards (Prometheus, Grafana, Datadog)

### Chaos Engineering
- **Principles**: Intentionally inject failures to build resilience
- **Failure Injection**: Network latency, service outages, resource exhaustion
- **Hypothesis Testing**: Define steady state, introduce chaos, validate recovery
- **Progressive Rollout**: Start in non-production, gradually increase scope
- **Automation**: Continuous chaos experiments in production

### Tools
- **k6**: Modern load testing tool with JavaScript-based scripting
- **Gatling**: Performance testing with Scala-based scenarios
- **JMeter**: Traditional performance testing tool
- **Chaos Mesh**: Kubernetes-based chaos engineering platform
- **Gremlin**: Chaos engineering platform for resilience testing

### Job Seeker Example: Performance Engineering
- Load test job search API with k6 (1000+ concurrent users)
- Monitor application metrics with Prometheus/Grafana dashboards
- Implement distributed tracing for application submission workflow
- Conduct chaos engineering experiments (database failover, cache failures)
- Set up alerting for performance degradation (response time > 2s)
- Test autoscaling behavior under varying load patterns

## Key Takeaways

1. **AI/ML Testing** requires new approaches for model validation, bias detection, and continuous monitoring beyond traditional software testing
2. **Accessibility Testing** is both a legal requirement and ethical imperative, requiring automated tools and manual validation
3. **IoT and Blockchain Testing** introduce unique challenges around hardware, distributed systems, and security
4. **Performance Engineering** has evolved from point-in-time testing to continuous observability and proactive resilience building
5. Modern QE professionals must continuously adapt to emerging technologies and evolving quality standards
