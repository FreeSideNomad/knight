# Part 1: Ontological Taxonomy

## 1.1 Concept Hierarchy

The Quality Engineering ontology organizes all testing concepts into a hierarchical structure that integrates with Domain-Driven Design (DDD) tactical and strategic patterns, and User Experience (UX) architecture patterns.

### 1.1.1 Test Artifacts (Work Products)

Test artifacts are tangible outputs of the testing process that document test requirements, execution, and results.

```yaml
test_artifacts:
  strategic_level:
    - Test Strategy: "High-level description of test levels and approach for organization/program"
    - Test Policy: "Organization-wide rules and guidelines for testing"
    - Test Approach: "Overall testing methodology (shift-left, BDD, TDD, risk-based)"

  tactical_level:
    - Test Plan: "Scope, approach, resources, schedule for specific test activities"
    - Test Suite: "Collection of test cases organized by bounded context or feature"
    - Test Scenario: "BDD-style description of behavior (Given-When-Then)"
    - Test Case: "Specific input values, preconditions, expected results, postconditions"

  execution_level:
    - Test Data: "Input data and fixtures for tests, matching domain aggregates"
    - Test Script: "Automated test implementation code"
    - Test Results: "Actual outcomes from test execution"
    - Defect Report: "Documentation of identified issues with DDD/UX context"

  management_level:
    - Test Execution Plan: "Schedule and configuration for running tests"
    - Test Metrics Report: "Coverage, quality, and efficiency measurements"
    - Test Summary Report: "Overall test results and recommendations"
```

**DDD Integration Points:**
- Test Strategy aligns with bounded context boundaries
- Test Cases reference domain constructs (Value Objects, Aggregates)
- Test Data matches aggregate structure
- Defect Reports trace to specific domain patterns

**UX Integration Points:**
- Test Scenarios map to user workflows
- Test Cases reference UI components and pages
- Test Execution covers complete user journeys
- Defect Reports identify component or page issues

### 1.1.2 Test Activities (Process)

Test activities describe the actions testers perform throughout the software development lifecycle.

```yaml
test_activities:
  planning:
    - Test Planning: "Define test strategy, scope, resources, schedule"
    - Risk Analysis: "Identify and prioritize testing risks"
    - Test Estimation: "Estimate effort, time, resources needed"

  design:
    - Test Analysis: "Identify test conditions from requirements"
    - Test Design: "Apply techniques to create test cases"
    - Test Case Specification: "Document detailed test procedures"

  implementation:
    - Test Environment Setup: "Configure databases, services, test tools"
    - Test Data Preparation: "Create fixtures matching aggregates"
    - Test Automation: "Implement automated test scripts"

  execution:
    - Test Execution: "Run tests and record actual results"
    - Defect Logging: "Report and track defects"
    - Result Comparison: "Compare actual vs expected outcomes"

  evaluation:
    - Test Completion: "Verify exit criteria met"
    - Test Reporting: "Communicate results to stakeholders"
    - Process Improvement: "Retrospective and lessons learned"
```

**ISTQB Alignment:** These activities correspond to the ISTQB Foundation Level test process: Planning, Monitoring & Control, Analysis, Design, Implementation, Execution, Completion.

    - "Be consistent across the entire codebase"
    - "Prefix IDs with type indicator (tc_, vo_, bc_, etc.)"

  test_case_naming:
    - "Pattern: tc_{level}_{number}_{what_is_being_tested}"
    - "Example: tc_unit_001_vo_email_validation_accepts_valid_format"
    - "Be specific about the scenario being tested"
    - "Include expected behavior in name when clarifying"

  test_data_naming:
    - "Pattern: td_{validity}_{entity}_{variant}"
    - "Example: td_valid_candidate_ml_expert"
    - "Example: td_invalid_email_missing_at_symbol"
    - "Communicate data purpose and characteristics"

  avoid:
    - "Generic names: test1, test2, data1"
    - "Unclear abbreviations: tc_u_001 (what does 'u' mean?)"
    - "Inconsistent casing: TestCase vs test_case vs testCase"
    - "Redundancy: test_test_case_for_email"
```

# Part 2: Core Terminology and Definitions

## 2.1 Test Artifacts

Test artifacts are work products created during the testing process. Each artifact serves a specific purpose in documenting test requirements, execution, and results.

### 2.1.1 Test Strategy

**Definition:** A high-level description of the test levels to be performed and the testing within those levels for an organization or program (one or more projects).

**Purpose:**
- Establish organization-wide testing approach
- Define test levels and types to be used
- Set quality gates and acceptance criteria
- Align testing with business objectives

**Structure (YAML Schema Fields):**
```yaml
test_strategy:
  id: string  # ts_{system}_{name}
  name: string
  system_ref: string
  description: string
  risk_level: enum [low, medium, high, critical]

  test_levels: []  # unit, integration, system, acceptance, etc.
  test_types: []   # functional, performance, security, etc.
  automation_target: integer  # percentage

  quality_gates:
    - gate: string
      blocking: boolean

  scope:
    in_scope: []
    out_of_scope: []

  dependencies: []
```

**DDD/UX Integration:**
- Test strategy aligns with bounded context boundaries
- Each bounded context has defined test requirements
- Quality gates enforce domain invariant testing
- UI testing strategy follows Atomic Design hierarchy

**Job Seeker Example:**
```yaml
id: "ts_job_seeker_main"
name: "Job Seeker Application Test Strategy"
test_levels:
  - unit          # Value Objects, Entities, Atoms, Molecules
  - integration   # Aggregates, Repositories, Pages
  - system        # Bounded Contexts, Workflows
  - acceptance    # User Stories, User Journeys
  - performance   # Load, stress testing
  - security      # Authentication, authorization
  - accessibility # WCAG 2.2 Level AA

quality_gates:
  - gate: "Unit test coverage >= 90% for domain layer"
    blocking: true
  - gate: "All critical E2E tests passing"
    blocking: true
  - gate: "WCAG 2.2 Level AA compliance"
    blocking: true
  - gate: "No critical or high severity defects"
    blocking: true
```

**Best Practices:**
- Review and update strategy quarterly
- Align with organizational quality objectives
- Balance thoroughness with efficiency
- Document rationale for test level selection
- Include accessibility requirements early

---

### 2.1.2 Test Plan

**Definition:** A document describing the scope, approach, resources, and schedule of intended test activities.

**Purpose:**
- Define specific testing activities for a feature or bounded context
- Allocate resources and schedule
- Identify risks and mitigation strategies
- Establish entry and exit criteria

**Structure (YAML Schema Fields):**
```yaml
test_plan:
  id: string  # tp_{bounded_context}_{name}
  name: string
  test_strategy_ref: string
  bounded_context_ref: string  # DDD integration
  description: string

  objectives: []

  scope:
    aggregates: []
    repositories: []
    services: []
    events: []

  test_approach: []

  schedule:
    start_date: date
    end_date: date
    milestones:
      - milestone: string
        date: date

  owner: string
  priority: enum [critical, high, medium, low]
```

**DDD Integration:**
- Scoped to specific bounded contexts
- Lists aggregates, repositories, services to be tested
- Identifies domain events that need verification
- Maps test activities to domain capabilities

**UX Integration:**
- Includes pages and workflows in scope
- Specifies component testing requirements
- Defines user journey test scenarios
- Identifies accessibility testing needs

**Job Seeker Example:**
```yaml
id: "tp_profile_management"
name: "Profile Management Test Plan"
bounded_context_ref: "bc_profile"

objectives:
  - "Verify profile creation, update, and validation"
  - "Validate all value objects (email, skills, location, etc.)"
  - "Ensure profile completeness calculation accuracy"
  - "Test domain events publishing (ProfileUpdated, SkillsChanged)"

scope:
  aggregates: ["agg_candidate_profile"]
  repositories: ["repo_profile"]
  services: ["svc_app_update_profile", "svc_app_import_resume"]
  events: ["evt_profile_created", "evt_profile_updated"]

  ux_scope:
    pages: ["page_profile_edit", "page_profile_view"]
    workflows: ["wf_profile_setup", "wf_update_profile"]

test_approach:
  - "Unit tests for all value objects"
  - "Integration tests for repository operations"
  - "Component tests for profile UI components"
  - "E2E tests for profile creation workflow"

schedule:
  start_date: "2025-10-10"
  end_date: "2025-10-20"
  milestones:
    - milestone: "Unit tests complete"
      date: "2025-10-12"
    - milestone: "Integration tests complete"
      date: "2025-10-15"
```

**Best Practices:**
- Create one test plan per bounded context or major feature
- Review with domain experts and stakeholders
- Update as domain model evolves
- Link to requirements and user stories
- Include accessibility and performance requirements

---

### 2.1.3 Test Suite

**Definition:** A collection of test cases or test procedures to be executed in a specific test cycle.

**Purpose:**
- Group related test cases for execution
- Organize tests by bounded context or feature
- Enable selective test execution
- Facilitate test reporting and tracking

**Structure (YAML Schema Fields):**
```yaml
test_suite:
  id: string  # tsuite_{context}_{component_type}
  name: string
  description: string
  test_plan_ref: string
  test_level: string
  bounded_context_ref: string

  test_cases: []  # List of test case IDs

  execution_order: enum [sequential, parallel]
  tags: []
```

**DDD/UX Integration:**
- Organized by bounded context
- Groups tests for specific aggregates or repositories
- Includes UI component or page test suites
- Cross-references DDD and UX constructs

**Job Seeker Examples:**

**Unit Test Suite:**
```yaml
id: "tsuite_profile_value_objects"
name: "Profile Value Objects Unit Tests"
test_level: "unit"
bounded_context_ref: "bc_profile"
description: "Unit tests for all profile-related value objects"

test_cases:
  - "tc_email_valid"
  - "tc_email_invalid"
  - "tc_skills_validation"
  - "tc_location_validation"
  - "tc_experience_validation"

execution_order: "sequential"
tags: ["unit", "value_objects", "bc_profile"]
```

**Integration Test Suite:**
```yaml
id: "tsuite_profile_repository"
name: "Profile Repository Integration Tests"
test_level: "integration"
bounded_context_ref: "bc_profile"

test_cases:
  - "tc_profile_save"
  - "tc_profile_find_by_id"
  - "tc_profile_find_by_email"
  - "tc_profile_find_incomplete"

tags: ["integration", "repository", "bc_profile"]
```

**E2E Test Suite:**
```yaml
id: "tsuite_application_submission_e2e"
name: "Application Submission E2E Tests"
test_level: "e2e"
user_flow_ref: "wf_job_application"

test_cases:
  - "tc_apply_job_complete"
  - "tc_apply_job_validation"
  - "tc_apply_job_notification"

tags: ["e2e", "workflow", "application"]
```

**Best Practices:**
- Group tests logically (by feature, bounded context, or test level)
- Keep suites focused and cohesive
- Use tags for flexible test selection
- Run unit test suites frequently
- Run E2E suites on PR or nightly builds

---

### 2.1.4 Test Scenario (BDD)

**Definition:** A behavior-driven description of a specific system behavior written in Given-When-Then format.

**Purpose:**
- Express requirements in business language
- Enable collaboration between technical and non-technical stakeholders
- Provide clear acceptance criteria
- Serve as living documentation

**Structure (YAML Schema Fields):**
```yaml
test_scenario:
  id: string  # ts_{type}_{number}_{feature}
  feature: string
  user_story: string  # As a [role], I want [goal], So that [value]

  scenario_name: string
  scenario_description: string

  bounded_contexts_involved: []
  workflows_involved: []

  then_steps: []

  examples:
    - input: {}
      expected_output: {}

  acceptance_criteria: []

  tags: []
  priority: enum [critical, high, medium, low]
```

**DDD/UX Integration:**
- Maps to use cases and application services
- References bounded contexts involved
- Links to UX workflows and pages
- Validates business rules and domain events

scenario_name: "Successful application submission"
scenario_description: "Candidate with complete profile applies for active job"

bounded_contexts_involved:
  - "bc_profile"
  - "bc_job_catalog"
  - "bc_applications"

workflows_involved: ["wf_submit_application"]
pages_involved:
  - "page_job_detail"
  - "page_application_review"
  - "page_application_confirmation"

given_steps:
  - "Candidate logged in with complete profile"
  - "Active job posting exists (job_id: 'job_456')"
  - "Candidate has not yet applied for this job"

when_steps:
  - "Candidate navigates to job detail page for 'job_456'"
  - "Candidate clicks 'Apply for Job' button"
  - "Candidate reviews profile information in wizard"
  - "Candidate clicks 'Submit Application'"

then_steps:
  - "Application created with status SUBMITTED"
  - "ApplicationSubmitted event published with candidate_id and job_id"
  - "Confirmation page displays with application ID"
  - "Confirmation email sent to candidate"
  - "Application appears in candidate's applications list"

acceptance_criteria:
  - "Application saved to database with correct data"
  - "Domain event triggers email notification"
  - "UI displays success feedback"
  - "Application trackable in applications list"

tags: ["acceptance", "bdd", "user_story", "critical"]
priority: "critical"
```

**Gherkin Syntax Example:**
```gherkin
Feature: Job Application Submission

Scenario: Successful application submission
  Given candidate logged in with complete profile
  And active job posting exists (job_id: 'job_456')
  And candidate has not yet applied for this job
  When candidate navigates to job detail page for 'job_456'
  And candidate clicks 'Apply for Job' button
  And candidate reviews profile information in wizard
  And candidate clicks 'Submit Application'
  Then application created with status SUBMITTED
  And ApplicationSubmitted event published
  And confirmation page displays with application ID
  And confirmation email sent to candidate
  And application appears in candidate's applications list
```

**Best Practices:**
- Write scenarios in business language (avoid technical jargon)
- Include domain experts in scenario creation
- Keep scenarios focused on a single behavior
- Use examples to clarify edge cases
- Automate scenario execution with Cucumber/BDD frameworks

### 2.1.5 Test Case

**Definition:** A set of input values, execution preconditions, expected results, and execution postconditions, developed for a particular objective or test condition.

**Purpose:**
- Specify exactly what to test and how
- Provide repeatable test instructions
- Enable test automation
- Document expected behavior
- Trace to requirements

**Structure (YAML Schema Fields):**
```yaml
test_case:
  id: string  # tc_{level}_{number}_{name}
  name: string
  description: string

  test_level: enum [unit, integration, system, acceptance, ui, e2e]
  test_type: enum [functional, performance, security, usability, accessibility, reliability, maintainability]
  test_priority: enum [critical, high, medium, low]

  ddd_references:
    bounded_context: string
    aggregate: string
    value_object: string
    domain_service: string
    repository: string
    domain_event: string

  ux_references:
    page: string
    workflow: string
    component: string
    component_type: enum [atom, molecule, organism, domain_component]

  given:
    - condition: string
      setup: string

  when:
    - action: string
      parameters: {}

  then:
    - expectation: string
      verification_method: string

  test_data_refs: []

  assertions:
    - assertion_type: enum [equals, contains, exists, matches_pattern, throws_exception]
      target: string
      expected_value: any

  preconditions: []
  postconditions: []
  cleanup_steps: []

  status: enum [not_run, passed, failed, blocked, skipped]
  execution_time_ms: integer

  author: string
  automated: boolean

  tags: []
```

**DDD Integration:**
Test cases reference specific domain constructs they're testing:
- Value Objects for validation tests
- Aggregates for consistency tests
- Repositories for persistence tests
- Application Services for use case tests
- Domain Events for event publication tests

**UX Integration:**
Test cases reference UI constructs:
- Components (atoms, molecules, organisms)
- Pages for integration tests
- Workflows for E2E tests

**Job Seeker Examples:**

### 2.1.6 Test Data

**Definition:** Data created or selected to satisfy the preconditions and inputs to execute one or more test cases.

**Purpose:**
- Provide realistic inputs for tests
- Ensure consistency across test executions
- Match domain model structure (aggregates)
- Enable test repeatability
- Support both positive and negative testing

**Structure (YAML Schema Fields):**
```yaml
test_data:
  id: string  # td_{validity}_{entity_type}
  name: string
  description: string
  type: enum [fixture, seed_data, generated, file]
  format: enum [json, yaml, csv, sql, pdf]

  aggregate_type: string  # Which aggregate this represents
  bounded_context: string

  data: {}  # Structured data matching domain model

  satisfies_invariants: boolean
  valid_for_contexts: []

  reusable: boolean
  tags: []
```
