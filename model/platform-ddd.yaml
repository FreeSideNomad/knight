      Core domain managing SERVICE PROFILES for clients (not clients themselves - client
      data from SRF/GID). Three profile types: servicing, online (direct client), indirect
      (payor). Includes all service enrollment (stand-alone like BTR, online like Receivables,
      indirect like receivable-approval). Indirect client management is part of this domain
      since indirect clients exist only to serve indirect service profiles.
